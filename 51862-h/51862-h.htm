</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> author does not
think it necessary to offer any apology for having written a life
of Abélard. The intense dramatic interest of his life is known from
a number of brief notices and sketches, but English readers have no
complete presentation of the facts of that remarkable career in our
own tongue. The <i>History of Abailard</i> of Mr. Berington, dating from
the eighteenth century, is no longer adequate or useful. Many French
and German scholars have rewritten Abélard’s life in the light of
recent knowledge and feeling, but, beyond the short sketches to be
found in Compayré, Poole, Rashdall, Cotter Morison, and others, no
English writer of the nineteenth century has given us a complete
study of this unique and much misunderstood personality. Perhaps
one who has also had a monastic, scholastic, and ecclesiastical
experience may approach the task with a certain confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span></p>

<p>In the matter of positive information the last century has added
little directly to the story of Abélard’s life. Indirectly, however,
modern research has necessarily helped to complete the picture; and
modern feeling, modern humanism, reinterprets much of the story.</p>

<p>Since the work is intended for a circle of readers who cannot be
assumed to have a previous acquaintance with the authorities who
are cited here and there, it is necessary to indicate their several
positions in advance. The chief sources of the story are the letters
of Abélard and Heloise. The first letter of the series, entitled the
‘Story of my Calamities,’ is an autobiographical sketch, covering
the first fifty years of Abélard’s life. To these must be added the
letters of St. Bernard, abbot of Clairvaux: of Peter the Venerable,
abbot of Cluny: of Jean Roscelin, canon of Compiègne, Abélard’s early
teacher: and of Fulques of Deuil, a contemporary monk. A number
of Latin works written shortly after Abélard’s death complete, or
complicate, the narrative. The principal of these are: the <i>Vita
Beati Bernardi</i>, written by his monk-secretary:<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_vii">[p. vii]</span> the <i>Vita Beati Goswini</i>, by two monks
of the period: the <i>De gestis Frederici I.</i> of a Cistercian bishop,
Otto of Freising: the <i>Metalogicus</i> and the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i>
of John of Salisbury: and the <i>Vita Ludovici Grossi</i> and <i>De rebus a
se gestis</i> of Suger, abbot of St. Denis, and first royal councillor.
Many of the chronicles of the twelfth century also contain brief
references.</p>

<p>Chief amongst the later French historians is Du Boulai with his
<i>Historia Universitatis Parisiensis</i>—‘the most stupid man who ever
wrote a valuable book,’ says Mr. R. L. Poole. Amongst other French
chroniclers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries we may
mention: De Launoy (<i>De scholis celebrioribus</i>), Dubois (<i>Historia
Ecclesiæ Parisiensis</i>), Lobineau (<i>Histoire de Bretagne</i>), Félibien
(<i>Histoire de l’abbaye de Saint Denys</i> and <i>Histoire de la ville
de Paris</i>), Longueval (<i>Histoire de l’Église Gallicane</i>), Tarbé
(<i>Recherches historiques sur la ville de Sens</i>), and, of course,
the <i>Histoire littéraire de la France</i>, <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, and
ecclesiastical historians generally.</p>

<p>A large number of ‘lives’ of Abélard have been founded on these
documents. In French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[p.
viii]</span> we have <i>La vie de P. Abélard</i> of Gervaise, a monkish
admirer of the eighteenth century, far from ascetic in temper, but
much addicted to imaginative description: the historical essay
of Mme. and M. Guizot, prefixed to M. Oddoul’s translation of
the letters of Abélard and Heloise: the <i>Abélard</i> of M. Rémusat,
pronounced by Ste. Beuve himself to be ‘un chef d’œuvre’: and the
<i>Lettres Complètes</i> of M. Gréard, with a helpful introduction.
In German Reuter chiefly discusses Abélard as a thinker in his
<i>Geschichte der religiösen Aufklärung</i>: Deutsch is mainly preoccupied
with his theology in his <i>Peter Abälard</i>, but gives an exhaustive
study of the last years of his life in <i>Abälards Verurtheilung zu
Sens</i>: Neander discusses him in his <i>Heilige Bernhard</i>: and Hausrath
offers the most complete and authoritative study of his career and
character in his recent <i>Peter Abälard</i>. In English we have, as I
said, the eighteenth-century work of Berington, a small fantastic
American version (quite valueless), and the more or less lengthy
studies of Abélard found in Rashdall’s fine <i>Universities of Europe</i>,
Cotter Morison’s <i>Life and Times of St. Bernard</i> (scarcely<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[p. ix]</span> a judicious sketch),
Compayré’s <i>Abélard and the Universities</i> (in which the biography is
rather condensed), Roger Vaughan’s <i>Life of St. Thomas of Aquin</i>, and
Mr. R. L. Poole’s <i>Illustrations of the History of Mediæval Thought</i>
(from whom we may regret we have not received a complete study of
Abélard).</p>

  <p class="subh2">THE QUEST OF MINERVA</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Peter Abélard</span> was born
towards the close of the eleventh century. No other personality that
we may choose to study leads to so clear and true an insight into
those strange days as does that of the luckless Breton philosopher.
It was the time of transition from the darkest hour of mediæval
Europe to a period of both moral and intellectual brilliance. The
gloom of the ‘century of iron’ still lay on the land, but it was
already touched with the faint, spreading dawn of a new idealism.
There is, amongst historians, a speculation to the effect that the
year 1000 of the Christian era marked a real and very definite
stage in the history of thought. Usually we do violence to events
by our chronological demarcations; but it is said that Christendom
confidently expected the threatened rolling-up of the heavens and the
earth to take place in the year 1000. Slowly,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span> very slowly, the sun crept over the dial of
the heavens before the eyes of idle men. But no Christ rode on the
clouds, and no Anti-Christ came into the cities. And the heaviness
was lifted from the breasts of men, and the blood danced merrily
in their veins once more. They began again ‘to feel the joy of
existence,’ as an old writer has it, and to build up their towers
afresh in the sun-light.</p>

<p>It was a strangely chequered period, this that changed the
darkness of the tenth into the comparative radiance of the thirteenth
century. All life was overcast by densest ignorance and grossest
lust and fiercest violence, the scarcely altered features of the
‘converted’ northern barbarians; yet the light of an ideal was
breaking through, in the pure atmosphere of reformed monasteries,
in the lives of saintly prelates and women refined beyond their
age, and in the intellectual gospel of a small band of thinkers
and teachers. Amid the general degradation of the Church and the
cloister strong souls had arisen, ardent with a contagious fire of
purity. High-minded prelates had somehow attained power, in spite
of the net of simony and corruption. The sons of St. Benedict,
rising and falling too often with the common<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span> tide, had, nevertheless, guarded some
treasures of the earlier wisdom, and shared them lovingly at their
gates with the wandering scholar. Thousands there were who could
close heart and home at the fiery word of a preacher, and go to
starve their souls in the living tomb of a monastery. Thousands could
cast down their spades and their wine-cups, and rush to meet death in
the trail of a frenzied hermit.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They were the days of the travail of the
spirit; and they rise before us in arresting vision when we look into
the life of Peter Abélard.</p>

<p>That life begins some day in the last decade of the eleventh
century, when the young Breton, then in his fifteenth or sixteenth
year, went out from his father’s castle into the bright world on the
quest of Minerva. Of his earlier years we know nothing. Later fancy
has brooded over them to some purpose, it is true, if there are
any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> whom such things
interest. The usual unusual events were observed before and after his
birth, and the immortal swarm of bees that has come down the ages,
kissing the infant lips of poets and philosophers, did not fail to
appear at Pallet. In point of sober fact, we rely almost exclusively
on Abélard’s autobiography for the details of his earlier career, and
he tells us nothing of his childhood, and not much of his youth. It
matters little. The life of a soul begins when it looks beyond the
thoughts of parents and teachers—if it ever do—out into the defiant
world, and frames a view and a purpose.</p>

<p>The home from which Abélard issued, somewhere about the year 1095,
was an ancient castle at Pallet, in Brittany, about eleven miles
to the south-east of Nantes. At the end of the village, which was
threaded on the high road from Nantes to Poitiers, a steep eminence
dominated the narrow flood of the Sanguèze. The castle was built on
this: overlooking the village more, as it chanced, in a spirit of
friendly care than of haughty menace. The spot is still visited by
many a pilgrim—not with a priestly benediction; but the castle is now
the mere relic of a ruin. In the most penetrating movements of his
prophetic genius, Abélard never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p.
5]</span> foresaw the revolt of the serfs, or indeed any economic
development. In this one respect he failed to detect and outstrip
what little advance was made in his day. His father’s castle has
disappeared with the age it belonged to, and the sons of his vassals
now lay the bones of their dead to rest on his desolated hearth.</p>

<p>Bérenger, the father, was a noble of a rare type. He had
fortunately received a little culture before setting out in the
service of Hoel <small>IV.</small>, Duke of Brittany and Count of
Nantes, and he in turn communicated his taste and his knowledge to
his children. From the fact, too, that he and his wife Lucia adopted
the monastic life a few years after Abélard’s departure, we may
gather that they were also above the moral level of their class.
It is not idle to note that Abélard’s mind encountered no evil or
irreligious influences when it first opened. All the circumstances
that are known to us suggest a gentle, uplifting, and reverential
education. He was the eldest of the sons of Bérenger; and, partly, no
doubt, because greater care had been taken with his education, partly
in the necessary consciousness of mental power, he early determined
to leave home, and wander over the land in search of learning. His
words give one the impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p.
6]</span> that he shouldered a wallet, and sallied forth alone,
after the adventurous fashion of the day. However that may be, he
says that he resolved to leave the chances of the favour of Mars to
his brothers, and set out to woo the gentler Minerva. Abandoning the
rights of primogeniture and the possible grace of kings, he passed
away from the great castle, and turned eagerly in the direction of
the nearest school.</p>

<p>It was not uncommon in those ‘Dark Ages’ for a young noble to
resign the comfort of the château and the glamour of a courtly
life in this way. The scholastic fever, which was soon to inflame
the youth of the whole of Europe, had already set in. You could
not travel far over the rough roads of France without meeting
some foot-sore scholar, making for the nearest large monastery or
episcopal town. Before many years, it is true, there was a change, as
the keen-eyed Jew watched the progress of the fever. There arose an
elaborate system of conveyance from town to town, an organisation of
messengers to run between the château and the school, a smiling group
of banks and bankers. But in the earlier days, and, to some extent,
even later, the scholar wandered afoot through the long provinces
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span> France. Here and
there a noble or a wealthy merchant would fly past in his silks and
furs, with a body-guard of a dozen stout fellows; or a poor clerk
would jog along on his ass, looking anxiously towards each wood or
rock that bordered the road ahead. Robbers, frequently in the service
of the lord of the land, infested every province. It was safest to
don the coarse frieze tunic of the pilgrim, without pockets, sling
your little wax tablets and style at your girdle, strap a wallet of
bread and herbs and salt on your back, and laugh at the nervous folk
who peeped out from their coaches over a hedge of pikes and daggers.
Few monasteries refused a meal or a rough bed to the wandering
scholar. Rarely was any fee exacted for the lesson given. For the
rest, none were too proud to earn a few sous by sweeping, or drawing
water, or amusing with a tune on the reed-flute: or to wear the
cast-off tunics of their masters.</p>

<p>It is fitting that we should first find little Pierre—Master
Roscelin recalls him in later years as ‘the smallest of my
pupils’—under the care of a rationalist scholar. Love was the first
rock on which the fair promise of his early manhood was shattered,
but throughout the long, sternly religious years that followed,
it was his restless applica<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p.
8]</span>tion of reason to the veiled dogmas of faith that brought
endless cruelty and humiliation upon him. Now, Jean Roscelin, canon
of Compiègne, was the rationalist of his day. As Abélard was fated
to do, he had attempted to unveil the super-sacred doctrine of the
Trinity; not in the spirit of irreverent conceit, with which people
credited both him and Abélard, but for the help of those who were
afflicted with a keen intellect and an honest heart. For this he had
been banished from England in 1093, and from the kingdom of France,
and had settled in one or other of the Gaulish provinces.</p>

<p>Mme. Guizot, in her very careful study of Abélard, sees no
evidence for the statement that he studied under Roscelin, but
the fact is now beyond dispute. Otto von Freising, a contemporary
historian, says that he ‘had Roscelin for his first master’;
Aventinus and others also speak of Roscelin as an early teacher
of his. Roscelin himself, in a letter which it seems ‘frivolous,’
as Deutsch says, to hesitate to accept, claims that Abélard sat
at his feet—it was the literal practice in those days—‘from
boyhood to youth.’ Abélard, on the other hand, writes that he
attended Roscelin’s lectures ‘for a short time’; but this<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span> correspondence took place
at a moment when the one would be greatly disposed to exaggerate
and the other to attenuate. An anonymous anecdote, which we shall
examine presently, pretends that he found Roscelin unsatisfactory,
but ‘controlled his feeling so far as to remain under Roscelin for a
year.’ It is clear enough that he spent a few of his earlier years on
the hay-strewn floor of Master Roscelin’s lecture-hall.</p>

<p>There is some uncertainty as to the locality, but a sufficient
indication to impart an interest to the question. Roscelin says it
was at the ‘Locensis ecclesia.’ This is easily understood if we
interpret it to mean the monastery of Locmenach<a id="FNanchor_2"
href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in Brittany. The monks
of St. Gildas, on the coast of Brittany, a wild band whose closer
acquaintance we shall make later on, had established a branch
monastery at Locmenach. As will appear in due time, they would be
likely to have small scruple about increasing its revenue by erecting
a chair for one of the most famous dialecticians in Christendom,
in spite of his condemnation for heresy at London and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> Soissons. We have no
special information about the manner of school-life at Locmenach,
save that we know the monks of St. Gildas to have been the living
antithesis to the good monks of Bec; but it is interesting to find
Abélard studying dialectics under a famous rationalist, and in a
monastery that was subject to the Abbey of St. Gildas of Rhuys.
The dark pages of his later history will give point to the dual
circumstance.</p>

<p>There is one other, and less reliable, account of Abélard in
his school-days. In an anecdote which is found in one or two older
writers, and on the margin of an old Abélard manuscript, it is stated
that he studied mathematics under a certain Master Tirricus. The
anecdote is generally rejected as valueless, on the ground that it
contains clear trace of the work of a ‘constructive imagination’;
but Mr. Poole points out that ‘there is no reason to doubt’ the
authenticity of the substance of the narrative, and it seems to me
that the fictional element may be reduced to a very slender quantity.
The story runs that Tirric, or Theodoric, one day found Abélard
shedding tears of fruitless perspiration over mathematical problems.
He had already, it is said, mastered the higher branches<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span> of knowledge, and was
even teaching, but had omitted mathematics, and was endeavouring to
remedy the omission by taking private lessons from Tirric. Noting his
effort, the master is represented to say: ‘What more can the sated
dog do than lick the bacon?’ ‘To lick the bacon’ is, in the crude
Latinity of the age, <i>bajare lardum</i>, and the story pretends the
phrase afforded a nickname for Pierre (Bajolard or Baiolard), and
was eventually rounded into Abélard or Abailard. The construction is
so crude, and the probability that Abélard is a surname needing no
legendary interpretation is so high, that the whole anecdote is often
contemptuously rejected. It is surely much more reasonable to read
the phrase as a pun on Abélard’s name, which some later writer, to
whom the name was unfamiliar, has taken in a constructive sense.<a
id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There are several good reasons for retaining<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span> the historical framework of the
anecdote. It is a fact that Abélard never mastered mathematics;
chancing to mention arithmetic in one of his works, he says, ‘Of
that art I confess myself wholly ignorant.’ It was unfortunate for
mathematics. Most probably the puerility of that liberal art, in
its early mediæval form, repelled him. In the next place, there
was a distinguished master living in France of the name of Tirric,
or Theodoric, who is said to have had a leaning to mathematics. He
taught in the episcopal school at Chartres, long famous for the
lectures of his brother Bernard. Finally, a Master Tirric (presumably
the same) turns up at Abélard’s trial in 1121, and boldly and
caustically scourges papal legate and bishops alike. However, if we
attribute so much authority to the story, it clearly refers to a
later date. The picture of Abélard, already a teacher, sated with
knowledge, coming ‘in private’ to repair an omission in the course
of his studies, must be relegated to one of the intervals in his
teaching at Paris, not, as Mr. Poole thinks, to the period between
leaving Roscelin and arriving at Paris.</p>

<p>Abélard himself merely says that he ‘went wherever dialectics
flourished.’ For five or six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p.
13]</span> years he wandered from school to school, drawn onward
continually by the fame of schools and of masters. Schools were
plentiful, and the age was already rich in great teachers.
Charlemagne had inaugurated the scholastic age two hundred years
before with the founding of the Palace School, and had directed that
every monastery and every episcopal town should give instruction.
With periods of languor the Benedictines had sustained the scholastic
tradition through the soulless age that followed, and the second
half of the eleventh century saw a brisk development. There was the
great abbey of Bec, in Normandy, where St. Anselm still detained
crowds of pupils after the departure of Lanfranc. But at Bec the
students were not part of a ‘great undisciplined horde,’ as Rashdall
calls the students of the early Middle Ages. With its careful
regulations, its bare-back castigations, its expurgated classics,
and its ever watchful monks, it contrived at once to cultivate the
mind (in moderation) and to guard the sanctity of faith and morals.
Cluny, in the south, had a similar school at its gates, and the same
control of the scholars it lodged and fed. St. Denis, near Paris, had
another famous Benedictine school. The forty monasteries that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span> William of Dijon had
recently reformed had opened free schools for the wandering pupils,
and even fed the poorer youths.</p>

<p>Then there were men of European fame teaching in the cathedral
cloisters of the larger towns. At Chartres, good Bishop Ivo—the only
lawyer who ever lived and died in the odour of sanctity—had spent
much energy in the improvement of his school. Little John, or John
of Salisbury, has left us a proud record of its life at a slightly
later date, when Tirric and his brother Bernard presided over it.
At Tournai, Master Eudes of Orleans, the peripatetic of the time,
walked the cloisters all day with his questioning scholars, and
gathered them before the cathedral door of an evening to explain
the profound mysteries of the solid spheres that whirled overhead,
and of the tiny, immortal fires that were set in them. Other famous
episcopal schools were those of Tours, Rheims, Angers, and Laon. But
every bishop had his master or masters for the teaching of grammar,
rhetoric, and dialectics (the <i>trivium</i>), and in the larger towns
were ‘lectors’ of the other four liberal arts (the <i>quadrivium</i>),
music, geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy. Theology was taught under
the watchful eye of the bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p.
15]</span> and his chapter, and in time chairs of Hebrew, and,
with the progress of the Saracenic invasion of the intellectual
world, even of Arabic, were founded. At the abbey of St. Denis,
monk Baldwin, sometime physician to the King of England, taught and
practised the art of healing. At Chartres, also, medicine was taught
somewhat later; and there are stories of teachers of law. And beside
all these, there were the private masters, ‘coaches,’ etc., who
opened schools wherever any number of scholars forgathered.</p>

<p>Thus the historical imagination can readily picture all that is
contained in the brief phrase with which Abélard dismisses the five
or six years of his studies. ‘There was no regular curriculum in
those days,’ Mr. Rashdall says, in his study of the ‘Universities
of Europe’; but the seven liberal arts were taught, and were
gradually arranging themselves in a series under the pressure of
circumstances. Music Abélard certainly studied; before many years
his songs were sung through the length and breadth of France. None
of his contemporaries made a more eager and profitable study of what
was called grammar—that is, not merely an exercise in the rules
of Donatus and Priscian, but a close acquaintance with the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> great Latin poets and
historians. Rhetoric and dialectics he revelled in—‘I went wherever
dialectics flourished.’ To so good purpose did he advance in this
work of loosening the tongue and sharpening the wit, that throughout
his life the proudest orators and thinkers of Christendom shrank in
dismay from the thought of a verbal encounter with him. ‘I am a child
beside him,’ pleaded Bernard of Clairvaux, at a time when France, and
even Rome, trembled at the sound of his own voice. But we must defer
for a few pages the consideration of mediæval dialectics.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">‘Illi soli patuit quicquid scibile erat,’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">said an ancient epitaph; and, though the historian
handles epigrams with discretion, it must be admitted that Abélard
surpassed his contemporaries, not only in ability and in utterance,
but also in erudition. There is the one exception of mathematics, but
it seems probable that he despised what passed under that name in the
twelfth century. ‘Mathematics,’ he says somewhere, in a sarcastic
parenthesis, ‘the exercise of which is nefarious.’ But in the thrust
and parry of dialectics he found a keen delight; and so he wandered
from place to place, edging his logical<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> weapons on fellow-pupils and provincial
masters, until one day, about the opening year of the twelfth
century, he directed his steps towards far-famed Paris—beautiful,
naughty, brilliant, seductive Paris, even in those distant days.</p>

<p>But the Paris of the first decade of the twelfth century was
wholly different, not only from the Paris of to-day, but even from
the Paris of Victor Hugo’s famous picture.</p>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">If you</span> desire to see the
Paris of those early days, imagine yourself beside the spot where
the modern Pantheon stands. It is the summit of what Paris called
‘the hill’ for many a century—the hill of St. Genevieve. Save for
the large monastery of secular canons beside you, the abbey of St.
Genevieve, there is yet little sign of the flood of grimy masonry
that will creep up slowly from the river valley, as the ages advance,
and foul the sweet country for miles beyond. Paris lies down in
the valley below, a toy city. The larger island in the Seine bears
almost the whole weight of the capital of France. It has, it is true,
eaten a little way into the northern bank of the river, to which
it is joined by the Great Bridge. That is the Lombard Quarter, and
Lutetian commerce is increasing rapidly. Numbers of curious ships
sail up the broad, silver bosom of the Seine,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> and make for the port of St. Landry.
The commercial quarter is already spreading in the direction of
Montmartre, with the public butchery and bakery at its outskirt; but
it is a mere fringe. The broad valleys and the gentle hills that are
one day to support Paris are now clothed with vineyards and orchards
and cornfields, and crowned with groves of olive<a id="FNanchor_4"
href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and oak. On the nearer
side, too, the city has already overflowed the narrow limits of the
island. There are houses on the fine stone bridge, the Little Bridge,
and there is a pretty confusion of houses, chapels, schools, and
taverns gradually stealing up the slope of St. Genevieve. But, here
also, most of the hill is covered with gardens and vineyards, from
which a chapel or a relic of old Roman Lutetia peeps out here and
there—the ruins of the famous old thermæ lie half-way down the hill
below us—; and along the valley of the</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">‘... florentibus ripis amnis’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">(to quote a poet of the time), to east and
west, are broad lakes of fresh green colour, broken only in their
sweet monotony by an occasional island of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span> masonry, an abbey with a cluster of
cottages about it.</p>

<p>It is down straight below us, on the long, narrow island, that we
see the heart of France, the centre of its political, intellectual,
and ecclesiastical life. A broad, unpaved road, running from Great
Bridge to Little Bridge, cuts it into two. Church occupies most of
the eastern half, State most of the western; their grateful subjects
pack themselves as comfortably as they can in the narrow fringe
that is left between the royal and ecclesiastical domains and the
bed of the river. Each generation in turn has wondered why it was
so scourged by ‘the burning fire’ (the plague), and resolved to be
more generous to the Church. From the summit of St. Genevieve we see
the front of the huge, grey, Roman cathedral, that goes back to the
days of Childebert, and the residences of its prelates and canons
bordering the cloister. Over against it, to the west, is the spacious
royal garden, which is graciously thrown open to the people two or
three times a week, with the palace of King Philip at the extremity
of the island. That is Paris in the year of grace 1100; and all
outside those narrow limits is a very dream of undulating scenery,
with the vesture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span>
of the vine, the fir, the cypress, the oak, the olive, and the fig;
and the colour of the rose, the almond, the lily, and the violet; and
the broad, sweet Seine meandering through it; and the purest air that
mortal could desire.</p>

<p>To our young philosopher Paris probably presented itself first
in the character of ‘the city of philosophers.’ Each of the great
abbeys had its school. That of the abbey of St. Genevieve will soon
be familiar to us. The abbey of St. Germain of Auxerre, to the
north, and the abbey of St. Germain of the Meadow, to the west, had
schools at their gates for all comers. St. Martin in the Fields had
its school, and the little priory of St. Victor, to the east, was
soon to have one of the most famous of all schools of theology. The
royal abbey of St. Denis, a few miles away, had a school in which
Prince Louis was then being trained, together with the illustrious
Abbot Suger. A number of private schools were scattered about the
foot of St. Genevieve. The Jews had a school, and—mark the liberality
of the time—there was, or had been until a very few years before,
a school for women; it was conducted by the wife and daughters of
famous Master Manegold, of Alsace, women who were well versed<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span> in Scripture, and ‘most
distinguished in philosophy,’ says Muratori.</p>

<p>But Abélard went straight to the centre of Paris, to the cloistral
enclosure under the shadow of old Notre Dame,<a id="FNanchor_5"
href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> where was the first
episcopal school in the kingdom, and one of the first masters in
Christendom. William of Champeaux was a comparatively young master,
who had forced his way into high places by sheer ability. He was
held to be the first dialectician in France, and ‘almost the first
royal councillor.’ In the great philosophic controversy of the period
he was the leader of the orthodox school. The Bishop of Paris had
brought him to the island-city, and vested him with the dignity of
archdeacon of the cathedral and <i>scholasticus</i> (chancellor or rector)
and master of the episcopal school. So high was the repute of his
ability and his doctrine that, so Fleury says, he was called ‘the
pillar of doctors.’ From an obscure local centre of instruction he
had lifted the Parisian school into a commanding position, and had
attracted scholars from many lands. And he was then in the prime of
life. Within a few months Abélard made his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span> authority totter, and set his reputation
on the wane. In six or seven years he drove him, in shame and
humiliation, from his chair, after a contest that filled Christendom
with its echoes.</p>

<p>Let us repeat that William of Champeaux was then in the prime of
life, or only ten years older than Abélard. There are those who talk
of the ‘venerable teacher’ and the audacious, irreverent stripling.
This picture of the conflict is historically ridiculous. Rousselot
and Michaud, two of the most careful students of Champeaux’s
life, give the date of his birth as 1068 and 1070, respectively.
He had fought his way with early success into the first chair in
Christendom; he cannot have been much older than Abélard when he
secured it. Abélard had an immeasurably greater ability; he was
frankly conscious of the fact; and he seems promptly to have formed
the perfectly legitimate design of ousting William—whose philosophy
certainly seemed absurd to him—and mounting the great chair of Notre
Dame.</p>

<p>Such a thought would naturally take shape during the course of
the following twelve months. The only indication that Abélard gives
us is to the effect that William was well disposed towards him
at first, though there is no foundation in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span> recorded fact for the assertion that
William invited the youth to his house, but they were gradually
involved in a warm dialectical encounter. Abélard was not only
a handsome and talented youth (which facts he candidly tells us
himself), but he was a practised dialectician. The lectures of
those untiring days lasted for hours, and might be interrupted
at any moment by a question from a scholar. Moreover, William
was principally occupied with dialectics, and it would be quite
impossible—if it were desired—to instruct youths in the art of
disputing, without letting them exercise their powers on the hosts
of problems which served the purpose of illustration. Hence the
young Breton must have quickly brought his keen rapier into play.
The consciousness of power and the adolescent vanity of exhibiting
it, both generously developed in Abélard, would prepare the way for
ambition. Question and answer soon led on to a personal contest.</p>

<p>But there was a stronger source of provocation, and here it will
be necessary to cast a hurried glance at the great controversy of
the hour. Cousin has said that the scholastic philosophy was born
of a phrase that Boetius translated out of Porphyry. It is a good
epigram; but it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span>
the disadvantage of most epigrams—it is false. The controversy about
<i>genera</i> and <i>species</i> is by no means of vital importance to the
scholastic philosophy, as Abélard himself has said. However, there is
much truth in the assertion that this celebrated controversy, as a
specific question, may be traced entirely to Porphyry.</p>

<p>Boetius was the chief author read in the early mediæval schools.
Amongst other works they had his Latin translation of Porphyry’s
<i>Introduction</i> to Aristotle, and in one corner of this volume some
roving scholastic had been arrested by the allusion to the old Greek
controversy about <i>genera</i> and <i>species</i>. To put it shortly: we have
mental pictures of individual men, and we have also the idea of man
in general, an idea which may be applied to each and all of the
individual men we know. The grave problem that agitated the centuries
was, whether not only the individual human beings who live and move
about us, but also this ‘general man’ or species, had an existence
outside the mind. The modern photographer has succeeded in taking
composite photographs. A number of human likenesses are super-imposed
on the same plate, so that at length individual features are blended,
and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span> emerges
only the vague portrait of ‘a man.’ The question that vexed the
mediæval soul was, whether this human type, as distinct from the
individual mortals we see in the flesh, had a real existence.</p>

<p>In whatever terms the problem be stated, it is sure to appear
almost childish to the non-philosophical reader; as, indeed, it
appeared to certain scholars even of that time. John of Salisbury,
with his British common sense and impatience of dialectical subtlety,
petulantly spoke of it as ‘the ancient question, in the solution of
which the world has grown grey, and more time has been consumed than
the Cæsars gave to the conquest and dominion of the globe, more money
wasted than Crœsus counted in all his wealth.’ But listen to another
Briton, and one with the fulness of modern life outspread before him.
Archbishop Roger Vaughan, defending the attitude of the enthusiasts
in his <i>Thomas of Aquin</i>, says: ‘Kill ideas, blast theories,
explode the archetypes of things, and the age of brute force is
not far distant.’ And Rousselot declares, in his <i>Philosophie du
Moyen Age</i>, that the problem of universals is ‘the most exalted
and the most difficult question in the whole of philosophy.’ Poor
philosophy!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span> will be
the average layman’s comment. However, though neither ancient Greeks
nor mediæval formalists were guilty of the confusion of <i>ideas</i> and
<i>ideals</i> which Dom Vaughan betrays, the schoolmen had contrived to
connect the question in a curious fashion with the mystery of the
Trinity.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Jean Roscelin began to probe the question with
his dialectical weapons, the ears of the orthodox were opened wide.
The only position which was thought compatible with the faith was
realism—the notion that the species or the genus was a reality,
distinct from the individuals that belonged to it, and outside the
mind that conceived it. By and by it was whispered in the schools,
and wandering scholars bore the rumour to distant monasteries
and bishoprics, that Roscelin denied the real existence of these
universals. Indeed, in his scorn of the orthodox position, he
contemptuously declared them to be ‘mere words’; neither in the world
of reality, nor in the mind itself, was there anything corresponding
to them; they were nothing but an artifice of human speech. Europe
was ablaze at once. St. Anselm assailed the heretic from the
theological side; William of Champeaux stoutly led the opposition,
and the defence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>
realism, from the side of philosophy. Such was the question of the
hour, such the condition of the world of thought, when Pierre Abélard
reached the cloistral school at Paris.</p>

<p>If you stated the problem clearly to a hundred men and women who
were unacquainted with philosophic speculations, ninety-nine of them
would probably answer that these universals were neither mere words
nor external realities, but general or generalised ideas—composite
photographs, to use the interesting comparison of Mr. Galton, in
the camera of the mind. That was the profound discovery with which
Abélard shattered the authority of his master, revolutionised the
thought of his age, and sent his fame to the ends of the earth. He
had introduced a new instrument into the dialectical world, common
sense, like the little girl in the fairy tale, who was brought
to see the prince in his imaginary clothes.<a id="FNanchor_6"
href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This, at least, Abélard
achieved, and it was a brilliant triumph for the unknown youth: he
swept for ever out of the world of thought, in spite of almost all
the scholars of Christendom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p.
29]</span> that way of thinking and of speaking which is known as
realism. I am familiar with the opinion of scholastic thinkers in
this question, from the thirteenth century to the present day. It
differs verbally, but not substantially, from the conceptualism of
Abélard. The stripling of twenty or twenty-one had enunciated the
opinion which the world of thought was to adopt.</p>

<p>We still have some of the arguments with which Abélard assailed
his chief—but enough of philosophy, let us proceed with the story.
Once more the swift and animated years are condensed into a brief
phrase by the gloomy autobiographist; though there is a momentary
flash of the old spirit when he says of the earlier stage that he
‘seemed at times to have the victory in the dispute,’ and when he
describes the final issue in the words of Ovid,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">‘... non sum superatus ab illo.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">He soon found the weak points in William’s
armour, and proceeded to attack him with the uncalculating passion
of youth. It was not long before the friendly master was converted
into a bitter, life-long enemy; and that, he wearily writes, ‘was the
beginning of my calamities.’ Possibly: but it is not unlikely that he
had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span> a similar
experience at Locmenach. However that may be, it was a fatal victory.
Ten years afterwards we find William in closest intimacy and daily
intercourse with Bernard of Clairvaux.</p>

<p>Most of the scholars at Notre Dame were incensed at the success
of Abélard. In those earlier days the gathering was predominantly
clerical; the more so, on account of William’s championship of
orthodoxy. But as the controversy proceeded, and rumour bore its
echo to the distant schools, the number and the diversity of the
scholars increased. Many of the youths took the side of the handsome,
brilliant young noble, and encouraged him to resist. He decided to
open a school.</p>

<p>There was little organisation in the schools at that period—the
university not taking shape until fully sixty years afterwards
(Compayré)—and Abélard would hardly need a ‘license’ for the purpose,
outside the immediate precincts of the cloister. But William was
angry and powerful. It were more discreet, at least, not to create a
direct and flagrant opposition to him. The little group of scholars
moved to Melun, and raised a chair for their new master in that royal
town. It was thirty miles away, down the valley<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span> of the Seine; but a thirty mile walk was
a trifle in the days when railways were unknown, and William soon
noticed a leakage in his class. Moreover, Melun was an important
town, the king spending several months there every year. William made
strenuous efforts to have the new academy suppressed, but he seems
to have quarrelled with some of the courtiers, and these took up the
cause of the new master of noble rank.</p>

<p>When Abélard saw the powerlessness of the chancellor of Notre
Dame, he decided to come a little nearer. There was another fortified
and royal town, Corbeil by name, about half-way to Paris, and thither
he transferred his chair and his followers. The move was made, he
tells us, for the convenience of his students. His reputation was
already higher than William’s, and the duel of the masters had led to
a noisy conflict between their respective followers. Corbeil being
a comfortable day’s walk from Paris, there was a constant stream of
rival pupils flowing between the two. In the schools and the taverns,
on the roads and the bridges, nothing was heard but the increasing
jargon of the junior realists and conceptualists. Besides the great
problem, dialectics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>
had countless lesser ones that would furnish argumentative material
for an eternity. ‘Whether the pig that is being driven to market is
held by the man or the rope’; ‘whether a shield that is white on one
side and black on the other may be called either black or white,’ and
problems of that kind, are not to be compared in point of depth and
fecundity with such mere matters of fact as the origin of species.
But the long and severe strain had gravely impaired Abélard’s health;
he was compelled to close his school, and return to Brittany. William
was not the only one who rejoiced. The Church was beginning to view
with some alarm the spread of the new doctrine and the new spirit.
Cynical rivals were complaining that ‘the magician’ had brought ‘a
plague of frogs’ on the land.</p>

<p>Abélard tells us that he remained ‘for several years almost cut
off from France.’ Rémusat thinks it was probably during this period
that he studied under Roscelin, but there is now little room for
doubt that his intercourse with the famous nominalist falls in the
earlier years. Much more probable is it that we should assign his
relations to Tirric of Chartres to the later date. The substance
of the anecdote that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p.
33]</span> found on the margin of the Ratisbon manuscript seems to
accord admirably with Abélard’s circumstances in the period we have
now reached. The question, however, will interest few, beyond the
narrow circle of historical specialists. He himself is silent about
the few years of rest in the Breton castle, merely stating that
he returned to Paris when he had recovered his health. We have to
remember that the autobiography he has left us was entitled by him
the ‘Story of my Calamities.’ It is not the full presentment of the
swiftly moving drama of the life of Abélard. He speaks of joy only
when it is the prelude to sorrow, or when some faint spark of the old
ardour leaps into life once more.</p>

<p>When Abélard at length returned to the arena, he found a
significant change. William had deserted the cloistral school. In
a solitary spot down the river, beyond the foot of the eastern
slope of St. Genevieve, was a small priory that had belonged to
the monks of St. Victor of Marseilles. Thither, says Franklin,
William had retired ‘to hide his despair and the shame of his
defeat.’ The controversy had by no means been decided against him
yet. Indeed, William’s biographers loyally contend that he was
sincerely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span> touched
by the religious spirit of the age, and adopted the monastic life
from the purest of motives. Abélard, on the other hand, declares
that the inspiration came from a hope of exchanging the chair of
Notre Dame for that of an episcopal see. Abélard is scarcely an
ideal witness, though the passage was written nearly thirty years
afterwards, yet his interpretation is probably correct; at least,
if we take it as a partial explanation. William was shrewd enough
to see that his supremacy in the scholastic world was doomed, and
that the best alternative was a bishopric. He was still young
(about thirty-eight, apparently) and ambitious; in his character of
archdeacon, he was already only one step removed from the episcopate;
and he had influence and qualifications above the average. It is
scarcely correct to say, as Gervaise does, that at that time ‘the
monastery was the recognised path to the episcopacy,’ on account
of the wide degradation of the secular clergy. Their degradation
was assuredly deep and widespread, but so were simony and electoral
corruption. We generally find, in the old chronicles, one or other
of the deceased bishop’s archdeacons ascending the vacant throne.
However, William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span> of
Champeaux was a religious man; for the pious the surest path to the
episcopate passed through the monastery.</p>

<p>Whatever be the correct analysis of the motive—and it was probably
a complex feeling, including all the impulses suggested, which
William himself scarcely cared to examine too narrowly—the fact
is that in the year 1108 he donned the black cassock of the canon
regular, and settled with a few companions in the priory of St.
Victor. The life of the canons regular was a compromise between that
of the sterner monks and the unascetic life of the secular canons
and secular clergy. They followed, on the whole, the well-known rule
of St. Augustine. They arose at midnight to chant their matins, but,
unlike the Cistercians, they returned to bed as soon as the ‘office’
was over. They ate meat three times a week, and were not restricted
in the taking of fish and eggs. They had linen underclothing, and
much friendly intercourse with each other, and they were less rigidly
separated from the world. Altogether, not too rough a path to higher
dignities—or to heaven—and (a not unimportant point) one that did not
lead far from Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span></p>

<p>Such was the foundation of one of the most famous schools of
mystic theology. The abbey that William instituted, before he was
removed to the coveted dignity in 1113, has attained an immortality
in the world of thought through such inmates as Richard and Hugh of
St. Victor.</p>

<p>Abélard’s first impulse on hearing the news was to repair at once
to the cloistral school. He found the chair occupied. William had
not, in fact, resigned his title of scholastic, and he had placed a
substitute in the chair. It was a poor ruse, for there was now no
master in Christendom who could long endure the swift, keen shafts
of the ambitious Breton. Abélard would quickly make the chair of
Notre Dame uncomfortable for the most pachydermatous substitute; and
he seems to have commenced the edifying task at once, when he heard
that the unfortunate William had set up a chair of rhetoric at St.
Victor. Like a hawk, Master Peter descended on the ill-fated canon.
The Bishop of Mans had, it appears, stimulated William into a renewal
of activity, and he had chosen that apparently safe section of the
trivium, the art of rhetoric.</p>

<p>With what must have been a mock humility, Abélard went down the
river each day with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p.
37]</span> crowd of monks and clerks to receive instruction in
rhetoric from the new Prior of St. Victor’s. Deutsch remarks, with
Teutonic gravity, that we do not read of a reconciliation between the
two. Nor do we find that Abélard had been ‘converted’ to the spirit
of Robert of Arbrissel or Bernard of Clairvaux during his retirement
at Pallet. Abélard, now nearly thirty years of age, could have
taught William the art of rhetoric with more profit than he himself
was likely to derive from William’s <i>prælectiones</i>. His obvious aim
was to break William’s connection with Paris and with Notre Dame.
The high and gentle spirit of these latter days, that studies the
feelings of an antagonist, and casts aside an ambition that would
lead over the fallen fame of a fellow-man, did not commend itself to
the mediæval mind.</p>

<p>And so the contest ran on, until at length a new rumour was
borne over the roads and into the schools of Europe. The ‘pillar
of doctors’ was broken—had fallen beyond restoration. Guillaume de
Champeaux had changed his doctrine on the question of universals.
Swiftly the story ran over hill and dale—they were days when the
words of masters outstripped the deeds of kings<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> and the fall of dynasties: the
champion of realism had so far yielded to Abélard’s pressure
as to modify his thesis materially. For long years he had held
that the universal was <i>essentially</i> one and the same in all its
individuals; now he admitted that it was only <i>indifferently</i>, or
<i>individually</i>, identical.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The death of King Philip was a matter
of minor interest to a world that brooded night and day over the
question of genera and species.</p>

<p>Abélard felt that he need strive no longer in the hall of the poor
canon regular, and he turned his attention to the actual occupant of
the chair of Notre Dame. We need not delay in determining the name of
the luckless master, whether it was Robert of Melun, as some think,
or Adam of the Little Bridge, or Peter the Eater—poor man! a sad
name to come down the ages with; it was merely an allusion to his
voracious reading. He had the saving grace of common-sense, whatever
other gifts he was burdened with. As soon as he saw the collapse of
William’s authority and the dispersal of his pupils, he resolved to
decline a contest with the irresistible Breton.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span> He voluntarily yielded the chair to
Abélard, and took his place on the hay-strewn floor amongst the new
worshippers. Such a consummation, however, was not to the taste of
the angered scholastic. A substitute had, it seems, the power to
subdelegate his license, so that the installation of Abélard in the
cathedral school was correct and canonical. But William was still
scholastic of the place, and he had an obvious remedy. Robert, or
Peter, or whoever it may have been, depended on him, and he at once
set to work to recall the delegation. Abélard says that he trumped
up a false and most obnoxious charge against the intermediary.
He did, at all events, succeed in changing the appointment, and
thus rendering Abélard’s subdelegated license null. The new-comer
was a man of different temper, so that Abélard only occupied the
great chair ‘for a few days.’ He could not teach in or about the
episcopal school without a ‘respondent,’ and he therefore once more
transferred his chair to Melun.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Prior of St. Victor’s had won a pyrrhic<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span> victory. Whether or no Abélard had
learned a lesson from him, and began in his turn to practise the
subtle art of diplomacy, we cannot say, but Paris was soon too
warm for the prior. The lawless students respected his authority
no longer, and clamoured for Abélard. The king was dead: long live
the king! They discovered that William’s conversion was peculiarly
incomplete. For a man who had felt an inner call to leave the
world, he still evinced a fairly keen interest in its concerns.
William found their ‘ceaseless raillery’ intolerable. He fled, says
Archbishop Roger Vaughan, ‘to hide his shame in a distant monastery.’
Abélard merely records that ‘he transferred his community to a
certain town at some distance from the city.’ The path to Paris lay
open once more.</p>

</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">When</span> Abélard and his
admirers returned from Melun to Paris, they found William’s new
successor sitting resolutely in the chair of Notre Dame. From some
manuscripts of the ‘Story of my Calamities’ it appears that he had
won repute by his lectures on Priscian, the Latin grammarian. He had
thus been able to augment the little band who remained faithful to
William and to orthodoxy with a certain number of personal admirers.
Clearly, the episcopal school must be taken by storm. And so, says
Abélard, his pen leaping forward more quickly at the recollection,
twenty years afterwards, ‘we pitched our camp on the hill of St.
Genevieve.’</p>

<p>During the century that preceded the coalescence of the schools
into a university, St. Genevieve was the natural home of rebellion.
Roscelin had taught there. Joscelin the Red, another famous<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> nominalist, was teaching
there. The ‘feminists’ had raised their tabernacle there; the Jews
their synagogue. From its physical advantages the hill naturally
presented itself to the mind of every master who had designs on the
episcopal school or the episcopal philosophy. Its gentle, sunny
flanks offered ideal situations for schools, and the students were
breaking away more and more from the vicinity of the cloister and
the subordination it expressed. A new town was rapidly forming at
its foot, by the river, and on the northern slope; a picturesque
confusion of schools, chapels, brothels, taverns, and hospices. It
was the cradle of the famed Latin Quarter—<i>very</i> Latin in those days,
when the taverns swung out their Latin signs, ‘taverna de grangia,’
‘ad turbotum,’ ‘apud duos cygnos,’ and so forth, and the songs that
came from the latticed, vine-clothed arbours were half French, half
Celtic-Latin.</p>

<p>Abélard did not open a private school on ‘the hill.’ He delivered
his assault on ‘the island’ from the abbey of St. Genevieve at the
summit, the site now occupied by the Pantheon. There is nothing in
the least remarkable in the abbey opening its gates to one who was
obviously bent on assailing the great ecclesiastical school, and
who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span> was already
regarded as the parent of a new and freer generation of students.
The secular canons had little deference for authority and little
love of asceticism at that period. St. Norbert had fruitlessly tried
to reform them, and had been forced to embody his ideal in a new
order. Cardinal Jacques de Vitry, the classical censor of the twelfth
century, makes bitter comment on their hawks and horses, their
jesters and singing-girls, and their warmer than spiritual affection
for their sisters in religion, the ‘canonesses.’ It was natural
enough that an abbey of secular canons should welcome the witty and
brilliant young noble—and the wealth that accompanied him.</p>

<p>We have little information about the abbey at that precise date,
but history has much to say of its affairs some thirty or forty
years afterwards, and thus affords a retrospective light. In the
year 1146 Innocent the Second paid a visit to Paris. The relics of
St. Genevieve were one of the treasures of the city, and thither his
holiness went with his retinue, and King Louis and his followers.
In the crush that was caused in the abbey church, the servants of
the canons quarrelled with those of the court, and one of them
was unlucky enough to bring his staff down with some force<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span> on the royal pate. That
was a death-blow to the gay life of the abbey. Paris, through the
abbot of St. Denis, who was also the first royal councillor, quickly
obtained royal and papal assent to the eviction of the canons, and
they were soon summarily turned out on the high road. They did not
yield without a struggle, it is true. Many a night afterwards, when
the canons regular who replaced them were in the midst of their
solemn midnight chant, the evicted broke in the doors of the church,
and made such turmoil inside, that the chanters could not hear each
other across the choir. And when they did eventually depart for less
rigorous surroundings, they thoughtfully took with them a good deal
of the gold from Genevieve’s tomb and other ecclesiastical treasures,
which were not reclaimed until after many adventures.</p>

<p>To this abbey of St. Genevieve, then, the militant master led
his followers, and he began at once to withdraw the students from
Notre Dame, as he candidly tells us. If Bishop Galo and his chapter
found their cloistral school deserted, they might be induced to
consider Abélard’s gifts and influence. So the war went on merrily
between the two camps. The masters fulminated against each other;
the students ran from school to school,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span> and argued it out on the bridge and
in the taverns, and brought questions to their logical conclusion
in the Pré-aux-clercs.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There was certainly, as we saw previously,
ample room for litigation in the problems of mediæval dialectics.
John of Salisbury studied dialectics under Abélard at St. Genevieve
(though not in the abbey) at a later date, and he tells us that when
he returned to Paris twelve years afterwards he found his dialectical
friends just where he had left them. ‘They had not added the
smallest proposition,’ he says contemptuously. Little John preferred
‘philology,’ as they called classical studies in his day.</p>

<p>We get a curious insight into the school-life of the period in
the <i>Life of Saint Goswin</i>. Goswin of Douai—whom we shall meet again
once or twice—was studying in the school of Master Joscelin the Red,
down the hill. He was a youthful saint of the regulation pattern: had
borne the aureole from his cradle. About this time he is described as
brimming over with precocious zeal for righteousness, and astounded
at the impunity with which Abélard poured out his novelties.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> Why did not some one
silence ‘this dog who barked at the truth’? Already, the authors of
the saint’s life—two monks of the twelfth century—say, ‘Abélard’s
hand was against every man, and every man’s hand against him,’ yet
no one seemed inclined ‘to thrash him with the stick of truth.’ The
young saint could not understand it. He went to Master Joscelin at
length, and declared that he was going to do the work of the Lord
himself. Joscelin is reported to have endeavoured to dissuade him
with a feeling description of Abélard’s rhetorical power; we do not
know, however, that Joscelin was void of all sense of humour. In any
case the saintly youngster of ‘modest stature’ with the ‘blue-grey
eyes and light air’ had a good measure of courage. It will be
interesting, perhaps, to read the issue in the serio-comic language
of the times.</p>

<p>‘With a few companions he ascended the hill of St. Genevieve,
prepared, like David, to wage single conflict with the Goliath who
sat there thundering forth strange novelties of opinion to his
followers and ridiculing the sound doctrine of the wise.</p>

<p>‘When he arrived at the battlefield—that is, when he entered the
school—he found the master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p.
47]</span> giving his lecture and instilling his novelties into
his hearers. But as soon as he began to speak, the master cast an
angry look at him; knowing himself to be a warrior from his youth,
and noticing that the scholar was beginning to feel nervous, he
despised him in his heart. The youth was, indeed, fair and handsome
of appearance, but slender of body and short of stature. And when the
proud one was urged to reply, he said: “Hold thy peace, and disturb
not the course of my lecture.”’</p>

<p>The story runs, however, that Abélard’s students represented to
him that the youth was of greater importance than he seemed to be,
and persuaded him to take up the glove. ‘Very well,’ said Abélard,
and it is not improbable, ‘let him say what he has to say.’ It
was, of course, unfortunate for Goliath, as the young champion of
orthodoxy, aided by the Holy Spirit, completely crushed him in the
midst of his own pupils.</p>

<p>‘The strong man thus bound by him who had entered his house,
the victor, who had secured the Protean-changing monster with the
unfailing cord of truth, descended the hill. When they had come to
the spot where their companions awaited them in the distant schools
[<i>i.e.</i> when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> they
had got to a safe distance from Abélard’s pupils], they burst forth
in pæans of joy and triumph: humbled was the tower of pride, downcast
was the wall of contumacy, fallen was he that had scoffed at Israel,
broken was the anvil of the smiter,’ etc. etc.</p>

<p>The course of events does not seem to have been much influenced
by this breaking of the ‘anvil.’ Joscelin was soon compelled to seek
fresh pastures; he also found ultimate consolation in a bishopric,
and a share in the condemnation of Abélard. The commentator of
Priscian must then have received the full force of Abélard’s keen
dialectical skill and mordant satire. His students began to fall
away to the rival camp in large numbers. William was informed in his
distant solitude, and he returned (‘impudenter,’ says Abélard) in
haste to St. Victor’s. He opened his old school in the priory, and
for a time Paris rang more loudly than ever with the dialectical
battle. But William’s intervention proved fatal to his cause. The
substitute had kept a handful of students about him, Abélard says,
but even they disappeared when William returned. The poor Priscianist
could think of nothing better than to develop ‘a call to the monastic
life,’ and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span> he
obeyed it with admirable alacrity. However, just as Abélard was about
to enter on the last stage of the conflict, he was recalled to Pallet
by his mother.</p>

<p>The eleventh century had witnessed a strong revival of the
monastic spirit. When men came at length to feel the breath of an
ideal in their souls, the sight of the fearful disorder of the age
stimulated them to the sternest sacrifices. They believed that he
who said, ‘If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and
give to the poor,’ was God, that he meant what he said, and that
he spoke the message to all the ages. So there uprose a number of
fervent preachers, whose voices thrilled with a strange passion, and
they burned the Christ-message into the souls of men and women. In
Brittany and Normandy Robert of Arbrissel and two or three others
had been at work years before St. Bernard began his apostolate. They
had broken up thousands of homes—usually those which were helping
most to sweeten the life of the world—and sent husband and wife to
spend their days apart in monasteries and nunneries. The modern
world speaks of the harshness of it; in their thoughts it was only a
salutary separation for a time, making wholly<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span> certain their speedy reunion in a not too
ethereal heaven. In the great abbey of Fontevraud, founded by Robert
of Arbrissel in the year 1100, there were nearly four thousand nuns,
a large proportion of whom were married women. Even in their own
day the monastic orators were strongly opposed on account of their
appalling dissolution of domestic ties. Roscelin attacked Robert
of Arbrissel very warmly on the ground that he received wives into
his monasteries against the will of their husbands, and in defiance
of the command of the Bishop of Angers to release them: he boldly
repeats the charge in a letter to the Bishop of Paris in 1121. Not
only sober thinkers and honest husbands would resent the zeal of
the Apostle of Brittany; the courtly, and the ecclesiastical and
monastic, gallants of the time would be equally angry with him.
We have another curious objection in some of the writers of the
period. Answering the question why men were called to the monastic
life so many centuries before women, they crudely affirm that the
greater frailty of the women had made them less competent to meet
the moral dangers of the cenobitic life. Thus from one cause or
other a number of calumnies, still found in the chronicles, were
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span> circulation
about Robert of Arbrissel.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It would be interesting to know what
half-truths there were at the root of these charges; there may have
been such, in those days, quite consistently with perfect religious
sincerity. In the martyrologies of some of the monastic orders, there
are women mentioned with high praise who disguised themselves as men,
and lived for years in monasteries. It is noteworthy that mediæval
folk worked none of those miracles at the tomb of Robert of Arbrissel
that they wrought at the tombs of St. Bernard and St. Norbert. He is
not a canonised saint.</p>

<p>However, in spite of both responsible and irresponsible
opposition, Robert of Arbrissel, Vitalis the Norman, and other
nervous orators, had caused an extensive movement from the hearth
to the cloister throughout Brittany and Normandy, such as St.
Bernard inaugurated in France later on.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span> Home after home—<i>château</i> or
<i>chaumière</i>—was left to the children, and they who had sworn
companionship in life and death cheerfully parted in the pathetic
trust of a reunion. Abélard’s father was touched by the sacred fire,
and entered a monastery. His wife had to follow his example. Whatever
truth there was in the words of Roscelin, the Church certainly
commanded that the arrangement should be mutual, unless the lady
were of an age or a piety beyond suspicion, as St. Francis puts it
in his ‘Rule.’ Lucia had agreed to take the veil after her husband’s
departure. This was the news that withheld the hand of ‘the smiter’
on the point of dealing a decisive blow, and he hastened down to
Brittany to bid farewell to his ‘most dear mother.’ Not only in this
expression, but in the fact of his making the journey at all in the
circumstances, we have evidence of a profound affection. Since he had
long ago abdicated his rights of primogeniture, there cannot have
been an element of business in the visit to Pallet.</p>

<p>He was not long absent from Paris. The news reached him in
Brittany that the prior had at length discovered a dignified retreat
from the field. Soon after Abélard’s departure the bishopric of
Châlons-sur-Marne became vacant, and William<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span> was nominated for the see. He bade a fond
farewell to Paris and to dialectics. From that date his ability was
devoted to the safe extravagances of mystic theology, under the safe
tutorship of St. Bernard.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> He had left his pupil Gilduin to replace
him at St. Victor, and the school quickly assumed a purely
theological character; but the luckless chair of Notre Dame he
entrusted to the care of Providence.</p>

<p>Abélard now formed a resolution which has given rise to much
speculation. Instead of stepping at once into the chair of the
cloistral school, which he admits was offered to him, he goes off
to some distance from Paris for the purpose of studying theology.
It is the general opinion of students of his life that his main
object in doing so was to make more secure his progress towards the
higher ecclesiastical dignities. That he had such ambition, and was
not content with the mere chair and chancellorship of the cloistral
school, is quite clear. In his clouded and em<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span>bittered age he is said, on the high
authority of Peter of Cluny, to have discovered even that final
virtue of humility. There are those who prefer him in the days of
his frank, buoyant pride and ambition. If he had been otherwise
in the days of the integrity of his nature, he would have been an
intolerable prig. He was the ablest thinker and speaker in France. He
was observant enough to perceive it, and so little artificial as to
acknowledge it, and act in accordance. Yet there was probably more
than the counsel of ambition in his resolution. From the episode of
Goswin’s visit to St. Genevieve it is clear that whispers of faith,
theology, and heresy were already breaking upon the freedom of his
dialectical speculations. He must have recalled the fate of Scotus
Erigena, of Bérenger, of Roscelin, and other philosophic thinkers.
Philosophic thought was subtly linked with ecclesiastical dogma. He
who contemplated a life of speculation and teaching could not afford
to be ignorant of the ecclesiastical claims on and limitations of his
sphere. Such thoughts can scarcely have been unknown to him during
the preceding year or two, and it seems just and reasonable to trace
the issue of them in his resolution. He himself merely says: ‘I
returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span> chiefly
for the purpose of studying divinity.’ Hausrath quotes a passage from
his <i>Introductio ad theologiam</i> with the intention of making Abélard
ascribe his resolution to the suggestion of his admirers. On careful
examination the passage seems to refer to his purpose of writing on
theology, not to his initial purpose of studying it.</p>

<p>Abélard would naturally look about for the first theological
teacher in France. There were, in point of fact, few theological
chairs at that time, but there was at least one French theologian who
had a high reputation throughout Christendom. Pupil of St. Anselm of
Canterbury at Bec, canon and dean of the town where he taught, Anselm
of Laon counted so many brilliant scholars amongst his followers that
he has been entitled the ‘doctor of doctors.’ William of Champeaux,
William of Canterbury, and a large number of distinguished masters,
sat at his feet. His <i>scholia</i> to the Vulgate were in use in the
schools for centuries. He and his brother Raoul had made Laon a
most important focus of theological activity for more countries
than France. England was well represented there. John of Salisbury
frequently has occasion to illustrate the fame and magnitude of the
cathedral school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span></p>

<p>Anselm had been teaching for forty years when Abélard, <i>aetat.</i>
thirty-four, appeared amidst the crowd of his hearers. We can
well conceive the fluttering of wings that must have occurred,
but Laon was not Paris, and Anselm was not the man to enter upon
an argumentative conflict with the shrewd-tongued adventurer.
Two incidents of contemporary life at Laon, in which Anselm
figured, will be the best means of illustrating the character of
the theologian. Abbot Guibertus, of that period, has left us a
delightful work ‘<i>De vita sua</i>,’ from which we learn much about
Laon and Anselm. The treasure of the cathedral was entrusted, it
seems, to seven guardians—four clerics and three laymen. One of
these guardians, a Canon Anselm, was a wolf in sheep’s clothing. He
purloined a good deal of the treasure; and when the goldsmith, his
accomplice, was detected, and turned king’s evidence, Anselm denied
the story, challenged the goldsmith to the usual duel, and won.<a
id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
canon was encouraged, and shortly set up as an expert burglar. One
dark,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> stormy
night he went with his ‘ladders and machines’ to a tower in which
much treasure was kept, and ‘cracked’ it. There was dreadful ado in
the city next day; most horrible of all, the burglar had stolen a
golden dove which contained some of the hair and some of the milk
of the Virgin Mary. In the uncertainty the sapient Master Anselm
(no relation, apparently, of Canon Anselm Beessus, the burglar
and cathedral treasurer) was invited to speak. His advice largely
reveals the man. Those were the days, it must be remembered, when the
defects of the detective service were compensated by a willingness
and activity of the higher powers which are denied to this sceptical
age. When their slender police resources were exhausted, the accused
was handed over to a priest, to be prepared, by prayer and a sober
diet of bread, herbs, salt, and water, for the public ordeal. On
the fourth day priests and people repaired to the church, and when
the mass was over, and the vested priests had prostrated themselves
in the sanctuary, the accused purged himself of the charge or
proved his guilt by carrying or walking on a nine foot bar of
heated iron, plunging his arms ‘for an ell and a half’ into boiling
water, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span> being
bodily immersed in a huge tank, cold, and carefully blessed and
consecrated.</p>

<p>These are familiar facts. The difficulty at Laon was that there
was no accused to operate on. The Solomon Laudunensis was therefore
called into judgment, and his proposal certainly smacks of the
thoroughness of the systematic theologian. A baby was to be taken
from each parish of the town, and tried by the ordeal of immersion.
When the guilty parish had been thus discovered, each family in
it was to purge itself by sending an infant representative to the
tank. When the guilt had been thus fastened on a certain house,
all its inmates were to be put to the ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_13"
href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>We see Anselm in a very different light in an incident that
occurred a year or two before Abélard’s arrival. Through the
influence of the King of England and the perennial power of gold a
wholly unworthy bishop had been thrust upon<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span> the people of Laon. Illiterate, worldly,
and much addicted to military society, he was extremely distasteful
to Anselm and the theologians. The crisis came when the English
king, Henry <small>I.</small>, tried to levy a tax on
the people of Laon. The bishop supported his patron; Anselm and
others sternly opposed the tax in the name of the people. Feeling
ran so high that the bishop was at length brutally murdered by some
of the townsfolk, and the cathedral was burned to the ground. Anselm
immediately, and almost alone, went forth to denounce the frenzied
mob, and had the unfortunate prelate—left for the dogs to devour
before his house—quietly buried.</p>

<p>Such was the man whom Abélard chose as his next, and last,
‘teacher.’ In the circumstances revealed in the above anecdotes it
would have been decidedly dangerous to attack Anselm in the manner
that had succeeded so well at Notre Dame. There is, however, no
just reason for thinking that Abélard had formed an intention of
that kind. No doubt, it is impossible to conceive Abélard in the
attitude of one who seriously expected instruction from a master.
Yet it would be unjust to assume that he approached the class-room
of the venerable, authori<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p.
60]</span>tative theologian in the same spirit in which he had
approached William of Champeaux’s lectures on rhetoric. We do not
find it recorded that he made any attempt to assail directly the high
position of the old man. It was sufficient for the purpose we may
ascribe to him that he should be able to state in later years that he
had frequented the lectures of Anselm of Laon.</p>

<p>With whatever frame of mind the critic came to Laon, he was not
long in discovering the defects of Anselm’s teaching. Anselm had one
gift, a good memory, and its fruit, patristic erudition. The fame
that was borne over seas and mountains was founded mainly on the
marvellous wealth of patristic opinion which he applied to every text
of Scripture. There was no individuality, no life, in his work. To
Abélard the mnemonic feat was a mechanical matter; and indeed, he
probably cared little at that time how St. Ambrose or St. Cyril may
have interpreted this or that text. Little as he would be disposed
to trust the fame of masters after his experience, he tells us that
he was disappointed. He found the ‘fig-tree to be without fruit,’
fair and promising as it had seemed. The lamp, that was said to
illumine theological Christendom, ‘merely<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span> filled the house with smoke, not light.’
He found, in the words of his favourite Lucan,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i22">‘magni nominis umbra,</p>
<p class="i0">Qualis frugifero quercus sublimis in agro’:</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">and he determined ‘not to remain in this idleness
under its shade very long.’ With his usual heedlessness he frankly
expressed his estimate of the master to his fellow pupils.</p>

<p>One day when they were joking together at the end of the lecture,
and the students were twitting him with his neglect of the class,
he quietly dropped a bomb to the effect that he thought masters of
theology were superfluous. With the text and the ordinary glosses
any man of fair intelligence could study theology for himself. He
was contemptuously invited to give a practical illustration of his
theory. Abélard took the sneer seriously, and promised to lecture
on any book of Scripture they cared to choose. Continuing the joke,
they chose the curious piece of Oriental work that has the title
of Ezechiel. Once more Abélard took them seriously, asked for the
text and gloss, and invited them to attend his first lecture, on
the most abstruse of the prophets, on the following day. Most of
them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span> persisted in
treating the matter as a joke, but a few appeared at the appointed
spot (in Anselm’s own territory) on the following day. They listened
in deep surprise to a profound lecture on the prophet from the new
and self-consecrated ‘theologus.’ The next day there was a larger
audience; the lecture was equally astonishing. In fine, Abélard was
soon in full sail as a theological lector of the first rank, and a
leakage was noticed in Anselm’s lecture hall.</p>

<p>Abélard’s theological success at Laon was brief, if brilliant. Two
of the leading scholars, Alberic of Rheims and Lotulphe of Novare,
urged Anselm to suppress the new movement at once. Seven years later
we shall meet Alberic and Lotulphe playing an important part in the
tragedy of Abélard’s life; later still Alberic is found in intimacy
with St. Bernard. The episode of Laon must not be forgotten. Probably
Anselm needed little urging, with the fate of William of Champeaux
fresh in his ears. At all events he gave willing audience to the
suggestion that a young master, without due theological training,
might at any moment bring the disgrace of heresy on the famous
school. He ‘had the impudence to suppress me,’ Abélard has the
impudence to say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>
The students are said to have been much angered by Anselm’s
interference, but there was no St. Genevieve at Laon—happily,
perhaps,—and Abélard presently departed for Paris, leaving the field
to the inglorious ‘Pompey the Great.’</p>

  <h2 title="CHAPTER IV - THE IDOL OF PARIS">CHAPTER IV</h2>
  <p class="subh2">THE IDOL OF PARIS</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">A new</span> age began for
Paris and for learning, when Peter Abélard accepted the chair of
the episcopal school. It would be a difficult task to measure the
influence he had in hastening the foundation of the university—as
difficult as to estimate the enduring effect of his teaching on
Catholic theology. There were other streams flowing into the life
of the period, and they would have expanded and deepened it,
independently of the activity of the one brilliant teacher. The
work of a group of less gifted, though highly gifted, teachers had
started a current of mental life which would have continued and
broadened without the aid of Abélard. Life was entering upon a
swifter course in all its reaches. Moreover, the slender rill of
Greek thought, which formed the inspiration of the eleventh century,
was beginning to increase. Through Alexandria, through Arabia,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span> through Spain, the broad
stream of the wisdom of the Greeks had been slowly travelling with
the centuries. In the twelfth century it was crossing the Pyrenees,
and stealing into the jealous schools of Europe. The homeless Jew was
bringing the strong, swift, noble spirit of the ‘infidel Moor’ into a
hideous world, that was blind with self-complacency. The higher works
of Aristotle (the early Middle Ages had only his logic), the words
of Plato, and so many others, were drifting into France. Christian
scholars were even beginning to think of going to see with their own
eyes this boasted civilisation of the infidel.</p>

<p>Yet it is clear that Abélard stands for a mighty force in the
story of development. At the end of the eleventh century Paris was
an island; at the end of the twelfth century it was a city of two
hundred thousand souls, walled, paved, with several fine buildings
and a fair organisation. At the end of the eleventh century the
schools of Paris, scattered here and there, counted a few hundred
pupils, chiefly French; at the end of the twelfth century the
University of Paris must have numbered not far short of ten thousand
scholars. Let us see how much of this was effected by Abélard.</p>

<p>The pupil who had left Paris when both<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> William and Abélard disappeared in 1113
would find a marvellous change on returning to it about 1116 or 1117.
He would find the lecture hall and the cloister and the quadrangle,
under the shadow of the great cathedral, filled with as motley a
crowd of youths and men as any scene in France could show. Little
groups of French and Norman and Breton nobles chattered together in
their bright silks and fur-tipped mantles, and with slender swords
dangling from embroidered belts; ‘shaven in front like thieves,
and growing luxuriant, curly tresses at the back like harlots,’
growls Jacques de Vitry, who saw them, vying with each other in the
length and crookedness of their turned-up shoes.<a id="FNanchor_14"
href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Anglo-Saxons looked on,
in long fur-lined cloaks, tight breeches, and leathern hose swathed
with bands of many coloured cloth. Stern-faced northerners, Poles,
and Germans, in fur caps and coloured girdles and clumsy shoes, or
with feet roughly tied up in the bark of trees, waited impatiently
for the announcement of ‘Li Mestre.’ Pale-faced southerners had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span> braved the Alps and the
Pyrenees under the fascination of ‘the wizard.’ Shaven and sandalled
monks, black-habited clerics, black canons, secular and regular,
black in face too, some of them, heresy-hunters from the neighbouring
abbey of St. Victor, mingled with the crowd of young and old, grave
and gay, beggars and nobles, sleek citizens and bronzed peasants.</p>

<p>Crevier and other writers say that Abélard had attracted five
thousand students to Paris. Sceptics smile, and talk of Chinese
genealogies. Mr. Rashdall, however, has made a careful study of the
point, and he concludes that there were certainly five thousand, and
possibly seven thousand, students at Paris in the early scholastic
age, before the multiplication of important centres. He points
out that the fabulous figures which are sometimes given—Wycliffe
says that at one time there were sixty thousand students at
Oxford, Juvenal de Ursinis gives twenty thousand at Paris in the
fifteenth century, Italian historians speak of fifteen thousand at
Bologna—always refer to a date beyond the writer’s experience, and
frequently betray a touch of the <i>laudator temporis acti</i>. It is,
at all events, safe to affirm that Abélard’s students were counted
by thousands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span> if
they had not ‘come to surpass the number of the laity’ [ordinary
citizens], as an old writer declares. Philippe Auguste had to direct
a huge expansion of the city before the close of the century. There
is nothing in the commercial or political development of Paris to
explain the magnitude of this expansion. It was a consequence of a
vast influx of students from all quarters of the globe, and the fame
of Master Abélard had determined the course of the stream.</p>

<p>One condition reacted on another. A notable gathering of students
attracted Jews and merchants in greater numbers. They, in turn,
created innumerable ‘wants’ amongst the ‘undisciplined horde.’ The
luxuries and entertainments of youth began to multiply. The schools
of Paris began to look fair in the eyes of a second world—a world of
youths and men who had not felt disposed to walk hundreds of miles
and endure a rude life out of academic affection. The ‘dancers of
Orleans,’ the ‘tennis-players of Poitiers,’ the ‘lovers of Turin,’
came to fraternise with the ‘dirty fellows of Paris.’ Over mountains
and over seas the mingled reputation of the city and the school was
carried, and a remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p.
69]</span> stream set in from Germany, Switzerland, Italy (even from
proud Rome), Spain, and England; even ‘distant Brittany sent you its
animals to be instructed,’ wrote Prior Fulques to Abélard (a Breton)
a year or two afterwards.</p>

<p>At five or six o’clock each morning the great cathedral bell would
ring out the summons to work. From the neighbouring houses of the
canons, from the cottages of the townsfolk, from the taverns, and
hospices, and boarding-houses, the stream of the industrious would
pour into the enclosure beside the cathedral. The master’s beadle,
who levied a precarious tax on the mob, would strew the floor of the
lecture-hall with hay or straw, according to the season, bring the
Master’s text-book, with the notes of the lecture between lines or on
the margin, to the solitary desk, and then retire to secure silence
in the adjoining street. Sitting on their haunches in the hay, the
right knee raised to serve as a desk for the waxed tablets, the
scholars would take notes during the long hours of lecture (about six
or seven), then hurry home—if they were industrious—to commit them to
parchment while the light lasted.</p>

<p>The lectures over, the stream would flow back<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span> over the Little Bridge,
filling the taverns and hospices, and pouring out over the great
playing meadow, that stretched from the island to the present Champ
de Mars. All the games of Europe were exhibited on that international
playground: running, jumping, wrestling, hurling, fishing and
swimming in the Seine, tossing and thumping the inflated ball—a game
on which some minor poet of the day has left us an enthusiastic
lyric—and especially the great game of war, in its earlier and less
civilised form. The nations were not yet systematically grouped, and
long and frequent were the dangerous conflicts. The undergraduate
mind, though degrees had not yet been invented, had drawn up an
estimate, pithy, pointed, and not flattering, of each nationality.
The English were, it is sad to find, ‘cowardly and drunken,’—to the
‘Anglophobes’; the French were ‘proud and effeminate’; the Normans
‘charlatans and boasters,’ the Burgundians ‘brutal and stupid’;
the Bretons ‘fickle and extravagant’; the Flemings ‘blood-thirsty,
thievish, and incendiary’; the Germans ‘choleric, gluttonous, and
dirty’; the Lombards ‘covetous, malicious, and no fighters’; the
Romans ‘seditious, violent, and slanderous.’ Once those war-cries
were raised, peaceable folk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p.
71]</span> hied them to their homes and hovels, and the governor
summoned his guards and archers.</p>

<p>The centre of this huge and novel concourse was the master of the
cathedral school. After long years of conventual life Heloise draws a
remarkable picture of the attitude of Paris towards its idol. Women
ran to their doors and windows to gaze at him, as he passed from
his house on St. Genevieve to the school. ‘Who was there that did
not hasten to observe when you went abroad, and did not follow you
with strained neck and staring eyes as you passed along? What wife,
what virgin, did not burn? What queen or noble dame did not envy my
fortune?’ And we shall presently read of a wonderful outburst of
grief when the news of the outrage done to Abélard flies through the
city. ‘No man was ever more loved—and more hated,’ says the sober
Hausrath.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand the charm of Abélard’s teaching.
Three qualities are assigned to it by the writers of the period, some
of whom studied at his feet: clearness, richness in imagery, and
lightness of touch are said to have been the chief characteristics of
his teaching. Clearness is, indeed, a quality of his written works,
though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span> they do not,
naturally, convey an impression of his oral power. His splendid gifts
and versatility, supported by a rich voice, a charming personality,
a ready and sympathetic use of human literature, and a freedom from
excessive piety, gave him an immeasurable advantage over all the
teachers of the day. Beside most of them, he was as a butterfly to
an elephant. A most industrious study of the few works of Aristotle
and of the Roman classics that were available, a retentive memory,
an ease in manipulating his knowledge, a clear, penetrating mind,
with a corresponding clearness of expression, a ready and productive
fancy, a great knowledge of men, a warmer interest in things human
than in things divine, a laughing contempt for authority, a handsome
presence, and a musical delivery—these were his gifts. His only
defects were defects of character, and the circumstances of his life
had not yet revealed them even to himself.</p>

<p>Even the monkish writers of the <i>Life of St. Goswin</i>, whose
attitude towards his person is clear, grant him ‘a sublime
eloquence.’ The epitaphs that men raised over him, the judgments of
episcopal Otto von Freising and John of Salisbury, the diplomatic
letter of Prior Fulques,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p.
73]</span> the references of all the chroniclers of the time, I
refrain from quoting. We learn his power best from his open enemies.
‘Wizard,’ ‘rhinoceros,’ ‘smiter,’ ‘friend of the devil,’ ‘giant,’
‘Titan,’ ‘Prometheus,’ and ‘Proteus,’ are a few of their compliments
to his ability: the mellifluous St. Bernard alone would provide a
rich vocabulary of flattering encomiums of that character: ‘Goliath,’
‘Herod,’ ‘Leviathan,’ ‘bee,’ ‘serpent,’ ‘dragon,’ ‘hydra,’ ‘Absalom,’
are some of his epithets. When, later, we find St. Bernard, the first
orator and firmest power in France, shrink nervously from an oral
encounter with him, and resort to measures which would be branded as
dishonourable in any other man, we shall more faithfully conceive the
charm of Abélard’s person and the fascination of his lectures.</p>

<p>Yet no careful student of his genius will accept the mediæval
estimate which made him the ‘Socrates of Gaul,’ the peer of Plato
and of Aristotle. He had wonderful penetration and a rare felicity
of oral expression, but he was far removed from the altitude of
Socrates and Plato and the breadth of Aristotle. He had no ‘system’
of thought, philosophical or theological; and into the physical
and social world he never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p.
74]</span> entered. His ideas—and some of them were leagues beyond
his intellectual surroundings—came to him piecemeal. Yet we shall
see that in some of those which were most abhorrent to Bernard—who
was the Church for the time being—he did but anticipate the judgment
of mature humanity on certain ethical and intellectual features of
traditional lore. The thesis cannot be satisfactorily established
until a later stage.</p>

<p>When we proceed to examine the erudition which gave occasion to
the epitaph, ‘to him alone was made clear all that is knowable,’
we must bear in mind the limitations of his world. When Aristotle
lent his mind to the construction of a world system, he had the
speculations of two centuries of Greek thinkers before him; when
Thomas of Aquin began to write, he had read the thoughts of
three generations of schoolmen after Abélard, and all the Arabic
translations and incorporations of Greek thought. At the beginning of
the twelfth century there was little to read beside the fathers. If
we take ‘all that was knowable’ in this concrete and relative sense,
the high-sounding epitaph is not far above the truth.</p>

<p>His Latin is much better than that of the great majority
of his contemporaries. Judged by a per<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>fect classical standard it is defective;
it admits some of the erroneous forms that are characteristic of
the age. But it is not without elegance, and it excels in clearness
and elasticity. It could not well be otherwise, seeing his wide
and familiar acquaintance with Latin literature. He frequently
quotes Lucan, Ovid, Horace, Vergil, and Cicero; students of his
writings usually add an acquaintance with Juvenal, Persius,
Statius, Suetonius, Valerius Maximus, Quintilian, and Priscian. It
was a frequent charge in the mouths of his enemies that he quoted
the lewdest books of Ovid in the course of his interpretation of
Scripture. The constant glance aside at the literature of human
passion and the happy flash of wit were not small elements in his
success. Those who came to him from other schools had heard little
but the wearisome iteration of Boetius, Cassiodorus, and Martianus
Capella. They found the new atmosphere refreshing and stimulating.</p>

<p>His command of Greek and Hebrew is a subject of endless dispute.
His pupil Heloise certainly had a knowledge of the two tongues,
as we shall see presently. She must have received her instruction
from Abélard. But it is clear that Abélard likes to approach a
controversy which turns on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p.
76]</span> the interpretation of the original text of Scripture
through a third person, such as St. Jerome. He rarely approaches
even the easy Greek text of the New Testament directly, and he has
no immediate acquaintance with any Greek author. Aristotle he has
read in the Latin translation of Boetius, through whose mediation
he has also read Porphyry’s <i>Isagoge</i>. He was certainly familiar
with the <i>De Interpretatione</i> and the <i>Categories</i>; Cousin grants
him also an acquaintance with the <i>Prior Analytics</i>; and Brucker
and others would add the <i>Sophistici Elenchi</i> and the <i>Topics</i>. The
physical and metaphysical works of Aristotle were proscribed at Paris
long after the Jewish and Arabian translations had found a way into
other schools of France. The golden thoughts of Plato came to him
through the writings of the fathers; though there is said to have
been a translation of the <i>Timæus</i> in France early in the twelfth
century.</p>

<p>His knowledge of Hebrew must have been equally, or even more,
elementary. Only once does he clearly approach the Hebrew text
without patristic guidance; it is when, in answering one (the
thirty-sixth) of the famous ‘Problems of Heloise,’ he adduces the
authority of ‘a certain Hebrew,’ whom he ‘heard discussing the
point.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span>’ In this we
have a clear clue to the source of his Hebrew. The Jews were very
numerous in Paris in the twelfth century. When Innocent the Second
visited Paris in 1131, the Jews met him at St. Denis, and offered him
a valuable roll of the law. By the time of Philippe Auguste they are
said to have owned two-thirds of the city: perceiving which, Philippe
recollected, or was reminded, that they were the murderers of Christ,
and so he banished them and retained their goods. Abélard indicates
that they took part in the intellectual life of Paris in his day; in
Spain they were distinguished in every branch of higher thought; and
thus the opportunity of learning Hebrew lay close at hand. One does
not see why Rémusat and others should deny him any acquaintance with
it. His knowledge, however, must have been elementary. He does not
make an impressive, though a novel, use of it in deriving the name of
Heloise (Helwide, or Helwise, or Louise) from Elohim, which he does,
years afterwards, in the sober solitude of his abbey and the coldness
of his mutilation.</p>

<p>Add an extensive acquaintance with Scripture and the fathers,
and the inventory is complete. Not difficult to be erudite in those
days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span> most people
will reflect. Well, a phonogram may be erudite. The gifts of Abélard
were of a higher order than industry and memory, though he possessed
both. He takes his place in history, apart from the ever-interesting
drama and the deep pathos of his life, in virtue of two distinctions.
They are, firstly, an extraordinary ability in imparting such
knowledge as the poverty of the age afforded—the facts of his career
reveal it; and secondly, a mind of such marvellous penetration that
it conceived great truths which it has taken humanity seven or
eight centuries to see—this will appear as we proceed. It was the
former of these gifts that made him, in literal truth, the centre
of learned and learning Christendom, the idol of several thousand
eager scholars. Nor, finally, were these thousands the ‘horde of
barbarians’ that jealous Master Roscelin called them. It has been
estimated that a pope, nineteen cardinals, and more than fifty
bishops and archbishops, were at one time among his pupils.</p>

<p>We are now at, or near, the year 1118. In the thirty-ninth year
of his age, the twenty-third year of his scholastic activity,
Abélard has reached the highest academic position in Christendom.
He who loved so well, and so naturally, to be<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span> admired, found himself the centre of a
life that had not been seen since Greek sages poured out wisdom in
the painted colonnade, and the marble baths, and the shady groves
of Athens. His self-esteem was flattered; his love of rule and of
eminence was gratified. Poor as many of his pupils were, their
number brought him great wealth. His refinement had ample means of
solacing its desires. The petty vexations of the struggle were nobly
compensated. Before him lay a world of fairest promise into which
he, seemingly, had but to enter. Then there arose one of the forces
that shattered his life, beginning its embodiment in an idyll, ending
quickly in a lurid tragedy. It is the most difficult stage in the
story of Abélard. I approach it only in the spirit of the artist,
purposing neither to excuse nor to accuse, but only to trace, if I
may, the development of a soul.</p>

<p>Abélard’s life had until now been purely spiritual, almost wholly
intellectual. His defects were spiritual—conceit and ambition;
if, as men assure us, it is a defect to recognise that you have a
supra-normal talent, and to strive for the pre-eminence it entitles
you to. The idealist spirit in which he had turned away from the
comfort and quiet of the château had remained<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span> thus far the one fire that consumed
his energy. In the pretty theory of Plato, his highest soul had
silenced the lower, and reduced the lowest to the barest requisite
play of vegetative life. There are men who go through life thus. The
scientist would crudely—it is the fashion to say ‘crudely’—explain
that the supra-normal activity of the upper part of the nervous
system made the action of the lower part infra-normal; but let
us keep on the spiritual plane. There are men whose soul is so
absorbed in study or in contemplation that love never reaches their
consciousness; or if it does, its appeal is faint, and quickly
rejected. The condition of such a life, highly prized as it is by
many, is constant intellectual strain.</p>

<p>Abélard had now arrived at a point when the mental strain began
instinctively to relax. Wealth would inevitably bring more sensuous
pleasure into his life. He was not one of the ‘purely intellectual’;
he had a warm imagination and artistic power. No immediate purpose
called for mental concentration. Sensuous enjoyment crept over the
area of his conscious life. During a large proportion of his time,
too, he was following with sympathy the quickening life of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> passionate creations
of Ovid and Vergil and Lucan. The inner judge, the sterner I, is
indisposed to analyse, unless education, or faith, or circumstance,
has laid a duty of severer watchfulness upon it. Blending with other
and not alarming sensuous feelings, veiling itself, and gently,
subtly passing its sweet fire into the veins, the coming of love is
unperceived until it is already strong to exert a numbing influence
on the mind. Abélard awoke one day to a consciousness that a large
part of the new sweetness that pervaded his life was due to the birth
of a new power in his soul—a power as elusive to recognition as it is
imperious in its demands. Then is the trial of the soul.</p>

<p>Before quoting Abélard’s confession, with respect to this
transformation of his character, it is necessary, out of justice to
him, to anticipate a little, in indicating the circumstances of the
making of the confession. The long letter which Abélard entitled the
‘Story of my Calamities’ was written twelve or thirteen years after
these events. By that time he had not only endured a succession of
cruel persecutions, but his outlook on life and on self had been
entirely changed. Not only had the memory of the events faded<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> somewhat, but he had
become colour-blind in an important sense. A frightful mutilation had
distorted his physical and psychic nature. Partly from this cause,
and partly under the stress of other circumstances, he had become a
Puritan of the Puritans, an ascetical hermit. As is the wont of such,
he manifests a tendency to exaggerate the shadows cast by actions of
his which he can no longer understand; for nature has withdrawn her
inspiration. On the point we are considering he does not evince the
smallest desire of concealment or palliation, but rather the reverse.
And, finally, the letter, though written ostensibly for the solace of
a friend in distress, was clearly written for circulation, and for
the conciliation of the gentler of the Puritans, who knew his life
well.</p>

<p>After speaking of the wealth and fame he had attained, he says:
‘But since prosperity ever puffs up the fool, and worldly ease
dissolves the vigour of the mind, and quickly enervates it by carnal
allurements; now that I thought myself to be the only philosopher
in the world, and feared no further menace to my position, whereas
I had hitherto lived most continently, I began to loose the rein to
passion. And the further I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p.
83]</span> advanced in philosophy and in reading Holy Writ, so
much the wider did I depart from philosophers and divines by the
uncleanness of my life. It is well known to thee that philosophers
and divines have ever been distinguished for this virtue of
continence. But, whilst I was thus wholly taken up with pride and
lust, the grace of God brought me a remedy, unwilling as I was,
for both maladies; for lust first, and then for pride. For lust,
by depriving me of its instrument; for pride—the pride which was
chiefly born of my knowledge of letters, according to the word of the
Apostle, ‘knowledge puffeth up’—by humbling me in the burning of the
book by which I set such store. And now I would have thee learn the
truth of both these stories, from the events themselves rather than
from rumour, in the order in which they befell. Since then I had ever
abhorred the uncleanness of harlots, and I had been withheld from the
company and intercourse of noble dames by the exactions of study, nor
had I more than a slight acquaintance with other women, evil fortune,
smiling on me, found an easier way to cast me down from the summit
of my prosperity; proud, as I was, and unmindful of divine favour,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span> goodness of
God humbled me, and won me to itself.’ And the penitent passes on
immediately to give the story of his relation to Heloise.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that all the vehement language with which he
scourges himself before humanity refers exclusively to his liaison
with Heloise. Searching about, as he does, for charges to heap upon
his dead self, he yet denies that he had intercourse with women of
any description before he knew the one woman whom he loved sincerely
throughout life. In a later letter to Heloise, not intended to
circulate abroad, he repeats the statement; recalling their embraces,
he says they were the more treasured ‘since we had never known the
like (<i>ista gaudia</i>) before.’ Moreover, he says a little later in
the ‘Story’ that up to the time of his liaison with Heloise he had
a ‘repute for chastity’ in the city; the events we have to follow
prove this to have been the case. Finally, let us carefully remember
that there would be no advantage in concealing any earlier disorder,
and that there is clear indication, even in the short passage I
have quoted, of a disposition rather to magnify faults than to
attenuate.</p>

<p>I labour the point, because a writer who has introduced Abélard to
many of the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>
generation, and for whom and whose thoughts I have otherwise a high
regard, has somehow been led to lay here a very damning indictment
of Abélard. Mr. Cotter Morison was a follower of the religion that
worships the departed great, and should have a special care to set
in light the character of those whom the Church has bruised in life,
and slandered after death, under a false view of the interest of
humanity. Yet, in his <i>Life of St. Bernard</i>, he has grossly added to
the charge against Abélard, with the slenderest of historical bases.
It were almost an injustice to Kingsley to say that Cotter Morison’s
Abélard recalls the great novelist’s pitiful Hypatia. The Positivist
writer thus interprets this stage in Abélard’s career. After saying
that his passion broke out like a volcano, and that he felt ‘a
fierce, fiery thirst for pleasure, sensual and animal,’ he goes on
in this remarkable strain: ‘He drank deeply, wildly. He then grew
fastidious and particular. He required some delicacy of romance, some
flavour of emotion, to remove the crudity of his lust. He seduced
Heloise.’</p>

<p>Was ever a graver perversion in the historical construction of
character by an impartial writer? Stranger still, Mr. Cotter Morison
has already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> warned
his readers that the ‘Story of my Calamities’ must be shorn of
some penitential <i>exaggeration</i>, if we are to give it historical
credence. But Mr. Morison has witnesses. Prior Fulques, in a letter
to Abélard, reminded him that he squandered a fortune on harlots. The
assertion of this monk of Deuil, based, professedly, on the reports
of Abélard’s bitter enemies, the monks of St. Denis, and made in a
letter which is wholly politic, is held by Mr. Morison to ‘more than
counterbalance’ the solemn public affirmation of a morbidly humble,
self-accusing penitent. And this, after warning us not to take
Abélard’s self-accusation too literally! I shall examine this letter
of Prior Fulques’ more closely later. Not only does the letter itself
belong to, but the charge refers to, a later period, and will be
weighed then. There is nothing at this stage to oppose to the quiet
and indirect claim of Abélard, allowed by the action of Fulbert,
that his character was unsullied up to the date of his liaison with
Heloise.</p>

<p>Let us return to the accredited historical facts. Somewhere
about the year 1118 Abélard first felt the claims of love. He was
wealthy and prosperous, and living in comparative luxury. He<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span> had those gifts of
imagination which usually reveal an ardent temperament. Whether it
was Heloise who unwittingly kindled the preparing passion, or whether
Abélard yielded first to a vague, imperious craving, and sought one
whom he might love, we do not know. But we have his trustworthy
declaration that he detested the rampant harlotry, and knew no woman
until he felt the sweet caress of Heloise.</p>

<p>I have now to set out with care the story of that immortal love.
But nine readers out of ten are minded to pass judgment on the
acts and lives of those we recall from the dead. My function is to
reconstruct the story as faithfully as the recorded facts allow. Yet
I would make one more digression before doing so.</p>

<p>What standard of conduct shall be used in judging Abélard?
There are a thousand moral codes—that of the Hindu and that of the
Christian, that of the twelfth century and that of the <i>twentieth</i>.
In the twelfth century even the St. Bernards thought it just that
a man who could not see the truth of the Church’s claims should
be burned alive, and his soul tortured for all eternity; that a
Being was just and adorable who tortured a twelfth century babe for
Adam’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span> sin; that
twelfth century Jews might be robbed because their remote ancestors
had put Christ to death; that the sanctity of justice demanded,
literally, an eye for an eye; and so forth. One may, of course,
choose whatever standard of conduct one likes to measure Abélard’s,
or anybody else’s, actions: Cardinal Newman, and such writers, have
a fancy for judging him by the perfected code of the nineteenth.
We cannot quarrel with them; though it is well to point out that
they are not measuring Abélard’s subjective guilt, nor portraying
his character, in so doing. And if any do elect to judge Abélard by
the moral code of the twelfth century, it must be noted that this
varied much, even on the point of sexual morality. St. Bernard and
his like saw an inherent moral evil in sexual union; they thought
the sanctity of the priestly character was incompatible with it,
and that virginity was, in itself, and by the mere abstinence from
sexual commerce, something holier than marriage. Apart from this, no
doubt—if it can be set apart in the question—good men were agreed.
But, as will appear presently, there were large bodies of men, even
clerks, who not only differed from them in practice, but also in
their deliberate moral judg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p.
89]</span>ment. We must approach closer still. When we have to
determine an individual conception of the law, for the purpose of
measuring real and personal guilt, we must have a regard to the
surrounding influences, the current thoughts and prevailing habits,
which may have impaired or obscured the feeling of its validity in
any respect. It is well, then, first to glance at the morals of the
time when one feels eager to measure Abélard’s guilt.</p>

<p>It was a period when the dark triumph of what is called
materialism, or animalism, was as yet relieved only by a sporadic
gleam of idealism. There was purity in places, but over the broad
face of the land passion knew little law. If the unlettered Greek
had immoral gods to encourage him, the mediæval had immoral pastors.
The Church was just endeavouring to enforce its unfortunate law
of celibacy on them. With a stroke of the pen it had converted
thousands of honest wives into concubines. The result was utter and
sad demoralisation. In thus converting the moral into the deeply
immoral, the Church could appeal to no element in the consciences of
its servants; nor even to its basic Scriptures. Writers of the time
use hyperbolic language in speaking of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> prevalent vice, and the facts given in
the chronicles, and embodied in the modern collections of ancient
documents, fully sustain it. Speaking of the close of the eleventh
century, Dubois, in his <i>Historia Ecclesiæ Parisiensis</i>, says: ‘The
condition of the Church [in general] at that time was unhappy and
wretched ... nearly all the clergy were infected with the vice of
simony ... lust and shameful pleasure were openly rampant.’ It is
true that he excepts his ‘Church of Paris,’ but his own facts show
that it is only a piece of foolish loyalty. Cardinal Jacques de
Vitry, who studied at Paris towards the close of the century (it must
have been worse in Abélard’s time), gives a clearly overdrawn, yet
instructive, picture of its life in his <i>Historia Occidentalis</i>. ‘The
clergy,’ he says, probably meaning the scholars in general, of whom
the majority were clerics, ‘saw no sin in simple fornication. Common
harlots were to be seen dragging off clerics as they passed along to
their brothels. If they refused to go, opprobrious names were called
after them. School and brothel were under the same roof—the school
above, the brothel below.... And the more freely they spent their
money in vice, the more were they commended, and regarded by almost
everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span> as fine,
liberal fellows.’ The vice that has ever haunted educational centres
and institutes was flagrant and general. It is a fact that the
authorities had at length to prohibit the canons to lodge students
in their houses on the island. In the country and in the other towns
the same conditions were found. In Father Denifle’s <i>Chartularium</i>
there is a document (No. <small>V.</small>) which throws
a curious light on the habits of the clergy. A priest of Rheims
was dancing in a tavern one Sunday, when some of the scholars
laughed at him. He pursued them to their school, took the place by
storm, half-murdered, and then (presumably recalling his sacerdotal
character) excommunicated them. At another time, Cardinal Jacques
tells us, the lady of a certain manor warned the priest of the
village to dismiss his concubine. He refused; whereupon the noble
dame had the woman brought to her, and ordained her ‘priestess,’
turning her out before the admiring villagers with a gaudy crown.
Another poor priest told his bishop, with many tears, that, if it
were a question of choosing between his church and his concubine,
he should have to abandon the church; the story runs that, finding
his income gone, the lady also departed. There is an equally<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> dark lament in Ordericus
Vitalis, the Norman, who lived in Abélard’s day. The letters and
sermons of Abélard—Abélard the monk, of St. Bernard, and of so many
others, confirm the darkest features of the picture. Only a few years
previously the king had lived with the wife of one of his nobles, in
defiance of them all; and when a council, composed of one hundred and
twenty prelates, including two cardinals and a number of bishops,
met at Poitiers to censure him, the Duke of Aquitaine broke in with
his soldiers, and scattered them with the flat of his sword. Indeed,
an ancient writer, Hugo Flaviniacensis, declares there was a feeling
that Pope Paschal did not, for financial reasons, approve the censure
passed by his legates.</p>

<p>Considering the enormous prevalence of simony, one could hardly
expect to find the Church in a better condition. The writers of
the time make it clear that there was an appalling traffic in
bishoprics, abbeys, prebends, and all kinds of ecclesiastical goods
and dignities. We have already seen one tragic illustration of the
evil, and we shall meet many more. A few years previously the king
had nominated one of his favourites, Étienne de Garlande, for the
vacant bishopric of Beauvais;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p.
93]</span> and this youth, ‘of no letters and of unchaste life,’ at
once took even major orders, and talked of going to Rome ‘to buy the
curia.’ But, as with regard to the previous point, it is useless to
give instances. Corruption was very prevalent; and one cannot wonder
at it in view of the reputation which the papacy itself had, in spite
of its occasional quashing of a corrupt election. This point will be
treated more fully in the sixth chapter.</p>

<p>The question of the deep and widespread corruption of the regular
clergy must also be deferred. In his fourth letter to Heloise,
Abélard complains that ‘almost all the monasteries of our day’ are
corrupt; Jacques de Vitry affirms that no nunneries, save those of
the Cistercians, were fit abodes for an honest woman in his day.<a
id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It
is not a little instructive to find Abbot Abélard, in his latest
and most ascetic period, telling his son (a monk), in the course
of a number of admirable moral maxims, that: ‘A humble harlot is
better than she who is chaste and proud,’ and that ‘Far worse is the
shrewd-tongued woman than a harlot.’</p>

<p>Finally, mention must be made of the extreme violence of the age.
Several illustrations have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p.
94]</span> been given in the course of the narrative, and it will
bring many more before the reader. They were still the days of the
<i>lex talionis</i>, the judicial duel, the ordeal, and the truce of God.
Murder was common in town and country. We have seen the brutal murder
of the Bishop of Laon in 1112; we find the Bishop of Paris threatened
by the relatives of his archdeacon, and the Prior of St. Victor’s
murdered by them, in 1133. But the story will contain violence
enough. As for ‘the undisciplined student-hordes of the Middle Ages,’
see the appalling picture of their life in Rashdall’s <i>Universities
of Europe</i>. Our period is pre-university—and worse: with the founding
of the university came some degree of control. Yet even then the
documentary evidence discloses a fearful condition of violence and
lawlessness. In the year 1197 we find the Bishop of Paris abolishing
the ‘Feast of Fools.’ On January 1st (and also on the feast of St.
Stephen), it seems, a carnival was held, during which the masquers
had free run of the cathedral and the churches, making them echo
with ribald songs, and profaning them with bloodshed and all kinds
of excess. In 1218, says Crevier, we find the ecclesiastical
judges of Paris complaining that the students break into the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span> houses of the citizens,
and carry off their womenfolk. In 1200 we find a pitched battle
between the students of Paris and the governor and his guards, in
which several are killed; and the king condemns the unfortunate
governor to be tried by ordeal; to be hanged forthwith if it proves
his guilt, and to be imprisoned for life (in case Providence has made
a mistake) if it absolves him. After another of these battles, when
the governor has hanged several students, the king forces him and his
council to go in their shirts to the scaffold and kiss the bodies.
In another case, in 1228, the king sides with the governor, and
the masters close the university in disgust until the students are
avenged.</p>

<p>But of story-telling there would be no end. And, indeed, there is
the danger of giving a false impression of scantiness of evidence
when one follows up a large assertion with a few incidents. It is,
however, clear from the quoted words of accredited historians, and
will be made clearer in the progress of the narrative, that simony,
unchastity, violence, cruelty, and usury were real and broad features
of the age of Abélard. The reader will not forget them, when he is
seeking to enter into the conscience of the famous master.</p>

  <p class="subh2">DEAD SEA FRUIT</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> great cemetery of Père
Lachaise at Paris is a city of historic tombs. Names of world-fame
look down on you from the marble dwellings of the dead, as you pass
along its alleys and broad avenues. Paris loves to wander there on
Sundays; to scatter floral symbols of a living memory on the youngest
graves, and to hang wreaths of unfading honour over the ashes of
those who have fought for it and served it. The memory of the dead
soon fades, they say, yet you will see men and women of Paris, on
many a summer’s day, take flowers and wreaths in solemn pity to lay
on the tomb of a woman who was dust seven hundred years ago. It is
the grave of Heloise, and of her lover, Abélard.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that in a serious endeavour to
depict the historical Heloise much myth and legend must be soberly
declined. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>
historians have been seduced from their high duty in writing her
praise: witness the fond exaggeration of M. de Rémusat, which would
make her ‘the first of women.’ Yet it must be admitted that impartial
study brings us face to face with a very remarkable personality.
This will be easily accepted in the sequel, when we have followed
the course of her life to some extent—when, for instance, we see the
affection and the extraordinary respect with which she inspires the
famous abbot of Cluny, Peter the Venerable. It is more difficult
to recall her at the period of her fateful meeting with Abélard.
We have, however, the sober assurance of Peter the Venerable that,
even at this early date, she was ‘of great repute throughout the
entire kingdom’; and there is no reason whatever to resent Abélard’s
assertion that she was already distinguished for her knowledge.</p>

<p>The mythic additions to the portraiture of Heloise refer almost
exclusively to her parentage and her beauty. Abélard introduces
her to us as the niece of a canon of the cathedral chapter, named
Fulbert. It is quite clear that Abélard considered her such
throughout life, and that it was the belief of Heloise herself;
but of her parentage neither of them speaks. In strict<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> justice, the only
inference we may draw from this is that she lost her parents at an
early age. We should never have known the parentage of Abélard but
for his own autobiography. However, the tradition that has charged
itself with the romance of Abélard’s life found in this silence a
convenient pretext for weaving further romantic elements into the
story. There is a pretty collection of myths about Heloise’s birth,
most of them, of course, making her illegitimate. The issue of lawful
wedlock is ever too prosaic and ordinary for the romantic faculty—in
spite of facts. The favourite theory is that Heloise was the daughter
of Canon Fulbert; even Hausrath thinks Fulbert’s conduct points to
this relationship. Two other canons of Paris are severally awarded
the honour by various writers. On the other hand, it was inevitable
that she should be given a tinge of ‘noble’ blood, and this is traced
on the maternal side. Turlot makes the best effort—from the romantic
point of view—in describing her as the daughter of an abbess, who was
the mistress of a Montmorency, but who gave an air of respectability
to her family matters by passing for the mistress of Fulbert. From
the less interesting point of view of history, we can only<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span> say that she lived with
her uncle, Canon Fulbert, and we must admit that we do not know
whether she was illegitimate or an orphan. But the former category
was very much the larger one, even in those violent days.</p>

<p>It was also natural that tradition should endow her with a
singular beauty: an endowment which sober history is unable to
confirm. She must, it is true, have had a singular grace and charm
of person. It is impossible to think that her mental gifts alone
attracted Abélard. Moreover, in the course of the story, we shall
meet several instances of the exercise of such personal power. But
we cannot claim for her more than a moderate degree of beauty.
‘Not the least in beauty of countenance,’ says Abélard, ‘she was
supreme in her knowledge of letters.’ The antithesis does not seem
to be interpreted aright by those writers who think it denies
her any beauty. ‘Not the least’ is a figure of rhetoric, well
known to Abélard, which must by no means be taken with Teutonic
literalness.</p>

<p>But that ‘repute throughout the kingdom,’ which Peter the
Venerable grants her, was based on her precocious knowledge. It
is generally estimated that she was in her seventeenth or<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span> eighteenth year when
Abélard fell in love with her. She had spent her early years at the
Benedictine nunnery at Argenteuil, a few miles beyond St. Denis.
Her education was then continued by her uncle. Canon Fulbert has no
reputation for learning in the chronicles of the time; in fact, the
only information we have of him, from other sources than the story of
Abélard, is that he was the happy possessor of ‘a whole bone’ out of
the spine of St. Ebrulfus. However, it is indisputable that Heloise
had a reputation for letters even at that time. Both Abélard and
Peter of Cluny are explicit on the point; the latter says to her, in
one of his admiring letters, ‘in study you not only outstripped all
women, but there were few men whom you did not surpass.’ From this
it is clear that the learning of Heloise was not distinguished only
when compared with the general condition of the feminine mind. In
fact, although Abbot Peter speaks slightingly of womanly education in
general, this was a relatively bright period. We have already seen
the wife and daughters of Manegold teaching philosophy at Paris with
much distinction at the close of the eleventh century, and one cannot
go far in the chronicles of the time without meeting many<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span> instances of a learned
correspondence in Latin between prelates and women.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the learning of Heloise cannot have been
considerable, absolutely speaking. Her opportunities were even more
limited than the erudition of her time. That she knew Hebrew is
explicitly stated by Abélard and Peter of Cluny, and also by Robert
of Auxerre; but she probably learned it (with Greek) from Abélard,
and knew no more than he. Her Latin is good; but it is impossible
to discuss here her famous <i>Letters</i>, which give us our sole direct
insight into her personality. Learned, critical, penetrative, she
certainly was, but Rémusat’s estimate is entirely inadmissible.
Beside Aspasia or Hypatia she would ‘pale her ineffectual fire.’</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand how the two were brought
together. Both of high repute ‘in the whole kingdom,’ or, at all
events, in Paris, they could not long remain strangers. Abélard
was soon ‘wholly afire with love of the maid,’ he tells us, and
sought an opportunity of closer intercourse with her. Though Cotter
Morison’s theory of the sated sensualist looking round for a dainty
morsel is utterly at variance with Abélard’s narrative—the only
account of these events that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p.
102]</span> we have—it is, nevertheless, clear that Abélard sought
the intimacy of Heloise for the purpose of gaining her love. He says
so repeatedly; and, though we have at times to moderate the stress
of his words, we cannot refuse to accept their substance. Mr. Poole
considers the idea of a deliberate seduction on the part of Abélard
‘incredible.’ It is strange that one who is so familiar with the
times should think this. ‘I thought it would be well to contract a
union of love with the maid,’ Abélard says. From the circumstance
that he had to approach Fulbert (who was, however, only too willing)
through the mediation of friends, it does not seem rash to infer that
he had had no personal intercourse with the canon and his niece. It
was through her fame and, perhaps, an occasional passing glance that
he had come to love her. He had, however, little diffidence about
the issue. Though between thirty-five and forty years of age, he
looked ‘young and handsome,’ he tells us; and we learn further from
Heloise that he had gifts ‘of writing poetry and of singing’ which
no female heart could resist. The ‘Socrates of Gaul’ set out on a
love-adventure.</p>

<p>And one fine day the little world of Paris was smirking
and chattering over the startling news<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span> that Master Peter had gone to live
with Heloise and her uncle. The simple canon had been delighted at
the proposal to receive Abélard. Alleging the expense of maintaining
a separate house and the greater convenience of Fulbert’s house
for attending the school, Abélard had asked his hospitality in
consideration of a certain payment and the instruction of Heloise in
leisure hours. It may or may not be true that Fulbert was avaricious,
as Abélard affirms, but the honour of lodging the first master
in Christendom and the valuable advantage to his niece are quite
adequate to explain Fulbert’s eager acceptance. ‘Affection for his
niece and the repute of my chastity,’ says Abélard, blinded the canon
to the obvious danger, if not the explicit intention. The master was
at once established in the canon’s house. One reads with pity how the
uncle, blind, as only an erudite priest can be, to the rounded form
and quickened pulse, child-like, gave Abélard even power to beat his
niece, if she neglected her task.</p>

<p>A tradition, which seems to have but a precarious claim to
credence, points out the spot where the idyll of that love was
lived. In the earlier part of the present century there was a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span> house at the corner
of the Rue des Chantres (on the island, facing the Hotel de Ville),
which bore an inscription claiming that ‘Heloise and Abélard, the
model of faithful spouses, dwelt in this house.’ If we accept the
vague legend, we can easily restore in imagination the little cottage
of Fulbert. It lay a few yards from the water’s edge, and one could
look out from its narrow windows over the gently sloping garden
of the bank and the fresh, sweet bosom of the river; the quays
were beyond—where the Hotel de Ville now stands—and further still
outspread the lovely panorama that encircled Paris.</p>

<p>In a very short time master and pupil were lovers. He did
assuredly fulfil his promise of teaching her. Most probably it
was from him that she learned what Greek and Hebrew she knew; for
Abélard, in later years, not only reminds her nuns that they ‘have a
mother who is conversant with these tongues,’ but adds also that ‘she
alone has attained this knowledge,’ amongst the women of her time. It
is also clear that he taught her dialectics, theology, and ethics.
But it was not long, he confesses, before there were ‘more kisses
than theses,’ and ‘love was the inspirer of his tongue.’ He does not
hesitate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span> to speak
of having ‘corrupted’ or seduced her, but it is only prejudice or
ignorance that can accept this in the full severity and gravity of
the modern term. Heloise had been educated in a nunnery; but before
many years we find these nuns of Argenteuil turned on the street
for ‘the enormity of their lives.’ The charge must not be taken too
literally just yet, but it should make us hesitate to credit Heloise
with a rigorous moral education. She lived, too, in a world where,
as we saw, such liaisons were not considered sinful. It is far from
likely that she would oppose any scruple to Abélard’s desire. Indeed,
from the study of her references to their love, in the letters she
wrote long years afterwards—wrote as an abbess of high repute—one
feels disposed to think that Abélard would have had extreme
difficulty in pointing out to her the sinfulness of such a love. It
is with an effort, even after twenty years of chaste, conventual
life, that she accepts the ecclesiastical view of their conduct.
Abélard sinned; but let us, in justice, limit his sin at least to
its due objective proportion; its subjective magnitude I shall not
venture to examine.</p>

<p>In a few months the famed philosopher ap<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>peared in a new character, as ‘the first
of the troubadours,’ to use the words of Ampère. ‘À mesure qu’on a
plus d’esprit les passions sont plus grandes,’ said Pascal. Of all
false epigrams that is surely the falsest, but it would be easily
inspired by the transformation of Pierre Abélard. The sober-living
man of forty, whom all had thought either never to have known or
long since to have passed the fever of youth, was mastered by a
deep, tyrannical passion. The problems of dialectics were forgotten,
the alluring difficulties of Ezechiel unheeded. Day after day the
murmuring throng was dismissed untaught from the cloistral school;
whilst passers-by heard songs that were ardent with deep love from
the windows of the canon’s house. All Paris, even all France, caught
the echo, says Heloise, and ‘every street, every house, resounded
with my name.’ The strange ‘Story of love and learning,’ as an old
ballad expressed it, was borne through the kingdom in Abélard’s
own impassioned words.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Months ran on, and the purblind priest re<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>mained wholly unconscious of what all
Paris sang nightly in its taverns. At length the truth was forced
upon his mind, and he at once interrupted the love-story. He drove
Abélard from the house, and raised the usual futile barriers to
the torrent of passion. Whether the canon was really more earnest
than the majority of his order, and therefore sincerely shocked at
the thought of the liaison, or whether it had disturbed some other
project he had formed, it is impossible to say. Heloise herself,
in her sober maturity, affirms that any woman in France would have
thought her position more honourable than any marriage. However that
may be, Fulbert angrily forbade a continuance of the relation. Once
more Abélard must have felt the true alternative that honour placed
before him: either to crush his passion and return to the school, or
to marry Heloise and sacrifice the desire of further advancement in
ecclesiastical dignity.</p>

<p>Abélard was not a priest at that time. He was probably a canon of
Notre Dame, but there are very satisfactory reasons for holding that
he did not receive the priesthood until a much later date. In the
‘Story’ he makes Heloise address him, about this time, as ‘a cleric
and canon,’ but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>
he is nowhere spoken of as a priest. Had he been a priest, the
circumstance would have afforded Heloise one of the most powerful
objections to a marriage; in the curious and lengthy catalogue
of such objections which we shall find her raising presently she
does not mention the priesthood. But even if he were a priest, it
is not at all clear that he would have considered this in itself
an impediment to marriage. From the acts of the Council of London
(1102), the Council of Troyes (1107), the Council of Rheims (1119),
and others, we find that the decree of the Church against the
marriage of priests, and even bishops, was far from being universally
accepted. Indeed, we have specific reason for thinking that Abélard
did not recognise an impediment of that character. In a work which
bears the title <i>Sententiae Abaelardi</i>, we find the thesis, more or
less clearly stated, that the priest may marry. The work is certainly
not Abélard’s own composition, but the experts regard it as a careful
summary of his views by some master of the period.</p>

<p>Apart from the laxer view of love-relation which Abélard probably
shared, we can only find firm ground to interpret his reluctance
to marry in the fear of injuring his further ambition.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span> Marriage was fast
becoming a fatal obstacle to advancement in the ecclesiastical world;
a lover—with wealth—was not a serious difficulty. Even this point,
however, cannot be pressed; it looks as though his ambition had
become as limp and powerless as all other feelings in the new tyranny
of love. Historians have been so eager to quarrel with the man that
they have, perhaps, not paid a just regard to the fact that Heloise
herself was violently opposed to marriage, and conscientiously
thought their earlier union more honourable. This will appear
presently.</p>

<p>Whatever struggle may have distracted Abélard after their
separation, he was soon forced to take practical measures. Heloise
found means to inform him—not with the conventional tears, but,
he says, ‘with the keenest joy’—that she was about to become a
mother. Fate had cut the ethical knot. He at once removed her
from Fulbert’s house during the night, and had her conveyed, in
the disguise of a nun,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> to his home at Pallet. It is not clearly
stated that Abélard accompanied her, but, beside the intrinsic
proba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>bility,
there is a local tradition that Abélard and Heloise spent many happy
months together at Pallet, and there is a phrase in the ‘Story’ which
seems to confirm it. However that may be, we find him in Paris again,
after a time, seeking a reconciliation with Fulbert.</p>

<p>Fulbert was by no means the quiet, passive recluse that one
would imagine from his earlier action, or inaction. The discovery
of Abélard’s treachery and the removal of his niece had enkindled
thoughts of wild and dark revenge. He feared, however, to attack
Abélard whilst Heloise remained at Pallet; it is a fearful commentary
on the times that Abélard should coolly remark that a retaliation on
the part of his own relatives was apprehended. Revenge was considered
a legitimate daughter of justice in those days. A compromise was at
length imagined by Abélard. He proposed to marry Heloise, if Fulbert
and his friends would agree to keep the marriage secret. In this we
have a still clearer revelation of the one serious flaw in Abélard’s
character—weakness. No doubt, if we had had an autobiography
from an unmaimed Abélard—an Abélard who identified himself with,
and endeavoured proudly to excuse, the lover of Heloise—we<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span> should be reminded
of many extenuating elements; the repugnance of Heloise, the
stupid anti-matrimonialism of the hierarchy, the current estimate
of an unconsecrated liaison, and so forth. Even as it is, Abélard
perceives no selfishness, no want of resolution, in his action.
‘Out of compassion for his great anxiety,’ he says, he approached
Fulbert on the question of a private marriage. The canon consented,
though secretly retaining his intention of taking a bloody revenge,
Abélard thinks; and the master hastened once more to Brittany for his
bride.</p>

<p>Abélard probably flattered himself that he had found an admirable
outlet from his narrow circumstances. Fulbert’s conscience would be
salved by the Church’s blessing on their love; the hierarchy would
have no matrimonial impediment to oppose to his advancement; Paris
would give an indulgent eye to what it would regard as an amiable
frailty, if not a grace of character. Unfortunately for his peace,
Heloise energetically repulsed the idea of marriage. The long passage
in which Abélard gives us her objections is not the least interesting
in the ‘Story.’</p>

<p>‘She asked,’ he writes, ‘what glory she would win from me, when
she had rendered me in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p.
112]</span>glorious, and had humbled both me and her. How great a
punishment the world would inflict on her if she deprived it of so
resplendent a light: what curses, what loss to the Church, what
philosophic tears, would follow such a marriage. How outrageous,
how pitiful it was, that he whom nature had created for the common
blessing should be devoted to one woman, and plunged in so deep
a disgrace. Profoundly did she hate the thought of a marriage
which would prove so humiliating and so burdensome to me in every
respect.’</p>

<p>Then follows an elaborate, rhetorical discourse on the
disadvantages of matrimony, with careful division and subdivision,
arguments from reason, from experience, from authority, and all the
artifices of rhetoric and dialectics. That the learned Heloise did
urge many of its curious points will scarcely be doubted, but as a
careful and ordered piece of pleading against matrimony it has an
obvious ulterior purpose. St. Paul is the first authority quoted;
then follow St. Jerome, Theophrastus, and Cicero. She (or he) then
draws an animated picture of the domestic felicity of a philosopher,
reminding him of servants and cradles, infant music and the chatter
of nurses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> the
pressing throng of the family and the helplessness of the little
ones. The example of monks, of Nazarites, and of philosophers is
impressively urged; and if he will not hesitate, as ‘a cleric and a
canon,’ to commit himself ‘irrevocably to domestic joy,’ at least
let him remember his dignity as a philosopher. The sad fate of the
married Socrates is adduced, together with the thunder and rain
incident. Finally, she is represented as saying that it is ‘sweeter
to her and more honourable to him that she should be his mistress
rather than his wife,’ and that she prefers to be united to him ‘by
love alone, not by the compulsion of the marriage vow.’</p>

<p>When the letter containing this curious passage reached Heloise,
nearly twenty years after the event, she, an abbess of high repute
for holiness, admitted its correctness, with the exception that ‘a
few arguments had been omitted in which she set love before matrimony
and freedom before compulsion.’ Holy abbess writing to holy abbot,
she calls God to witness that ‘if the name of wife is holier, the
name of friend, or, if he likes, mistress or concubine, is sweeter,’
and that she ‘would rather be his mistress than the queen of a
Cæsar.’ They who disregard these things in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> sitting in judgment on that famous
liaison are foredoomed to error.</p>

<p>But Abélard prevailed. ‘Weeping and sobbing vehemently,’ he says,
‘she brought her discourse to an end with these words: “One thing
alone remains for us now, we must exhibit in our common ruin a grief
as strong as the love that has gone before.”’ It is an artistic
termination to Abélard’s discourse, at all events.</p>

<p>Back to Paris once more, therefore, the two proceeded. Heloise
had a strong foreboding of evil to come from the side of Fulbert;
she did not trust his profession of conciliation. However, she
left her boy, whom, with a curious affectation, they had called
Astrolabe (the name of an astronomic apparatus), in the charge of
Abélard’s sister Denyse. They were married a few days after their
arrival at Paris. The vigil was spent, according to custom, in one
of the churches: they remained all night in prayer, and the ceremony
took place after an early Mass in the morning. Their arrival in
Paris had been kept secret, and only Fulbert and a few friends of
both parties were present at the marriage. Then they parted at the
altar: the man weakly proceeding to follow his poor ambition in the
school, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> noble
young wife making herself a sad sacrifice to his selfishness and
irresolution.</p>

<p>During the next few dreary months they saw each other rarely
and in secret. Abélard was a man of the type that waits for the
compulsion of events in a serious conflict of desires, or of desire
and duty. He could not lay aside his day-dream that somehow and some
day the fates would smooth out a path along which he could carry
both his whole ambition and his love. Events did decide for him once
more. Fulbert, it seems, broke his faith with Abélard and divulged
the marriage. But when people came to Heloise for confirmation, she
did more than ‘lie with the sweetness of a Madonna,’ in Charles
Reade’s approving phrase; she denied on oath that she was the wife
of Abélard. Fulbert then began to ill-treat her (the circumstance
may be commended to the notice of those historians who think he had
acted from pure affection), and Abélard removed her secretly from her
uncle’s house.</p>

<p>It was to the convent at Argenteuil that Abélard conveyed his wife
this time. One passes almost the very spot in entering modern Paris
by the western line, but the village lay at a much greater distance
from the ancient island-city, a few miles<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span> beyond St. Denis, going down the river.
It was a convent of Benedictine nuns, very familiar to Heloise, who
had received her early education there. In order to conceal Heloise
more effectually, he bade her put on the habit of the nuns, with
the exception of the veil, which was the distinguishing mark of the
professed religious. Here she remained for some months; Abélard
waiting upon events, as usual, and occasionally making a secret visit
to Argenteuil. According to Turlot, the abbess of Argenteuil was the
mother of Heloise. We know, at least, that the nunnery was in a very
lax condition, and that, beyond her unconquerable presentiment of
evil, Heloise would suffer little restraint. Indeed, Abélard reminds
her later, in his second letter to her, that their conjugal relations
continued whilst she was in the nunnery.</p>

<p>How long this wretched situation continued it is impossible to
determine. It cannot have been many months, at the most, before
Fulbert discovered what had happened; it was probably a matter
of weeks. Yet this is the only period in which it is possible
to entertain the theory of Abélard’s licentiousness. We have
already seen that Cotter Morison’s notion of a licentious<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span> period before the
liaison with Heloise is quite indefensible. The tragic event which we
have presently to relate puts the latest term to the possibility of
such licence. Now, there are two documents on which Abélard’s critics
rely: a letter to him from Fulques, prior in the monastery of Deuil
near Paris, and a letter from his former teacher, Master Roscelin.
Prior Fulques, however, merely says he ‘has heard’ that Abélard was
reduced to poverty through ‘the greed and avarice of harlots’; and
Roscelin explicitly states that he heard his story from the monks
of St. Denis. Indeed, we may at once exclude Roscelin’s letter; not
merely because it was written in a most furious outburst of temper,
when a man would grasp any rumour, but also on the ground that his
story is absurd and impossible. He represents Abélard, when a monk at
St. Denis, later, returning to his monastery with the money earned by
his teaching, and marching off with it to pay a former mistress. We
shall see, in a later chapter, that Abélard did not begin to teach
until he had left St. Denis.</p>

<p>If, however, Roscelin’s story is too absurd to entertain in
itself, it is useful in casting some light on Fulques’s letter.
Fulques was writing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p.
118]</span> Abélard on behalf of the monks of St. Denis. He would be
well acquainted with their gossip, and would, therefore, probably
be referring to the story which Roscelin shows to be impossible in
giving it more fully. It is not unlikely that the story was really
a perverse account of Abélard’s visits to Heloise at Argenteuil.
In any case we are reduced to the gossip of a band of monks of
notorious character (<i>teste</i> St. Bernard), of indirect and uncertain
information, and of bitter hostility to Abélard.</p>

<p>And this is all the evidence which can be found in support of
the calumny. On the strength of this monkish gossip we are asked to
believe that Abélard grossly deceived his young wife, and made an
attempt, as ridiculous (if the rumour contained truth) as it was
hypocritical, to deceive the readers of his heart-naked confession.
We are to suppose that ‘the abhorrence of harlots,’ of which he spoke
earlier, entirely disappeared when he found himself united by the
sacred bonds of both religion and love to a noble and devoted wife.
We are to suppose that his apparent detestation and condemnation
of his past conduct was a mere rhetorical artifice to conceal the
foulest and most extraordinary episode in his career from the
people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span> amongst
whom he had lived—an artifice, moreover, which would be utterly
inconsistent with his life and character at the time he wrote the
‘Story.’ It is almost impossible to take such a notion seriously.</p>

<p>Once more, then, we are in a period of waiting for the direction
of events. It came this time in tragic accents that for ever cured
the unfortunate Breton of his listless trust in fate.</p>

<p>Fulbert learned at length that Heloise had been sent to
Argenteuil, and had taken the habit. The canon at once inferred that
this was a preliminary step to a dissolution of the marriage. He
would be unaware that it had been consummated, and would suppose that
Abélard intended to apply to Rome for a dispensation to relieve him
of an apparent embarrassment. He decided on a fearful revenge, which
should at least prevent Abélard from marrying another.</p>

<p>And one early morning, a little later, Paris was in a frenzy of
excitement. Canons, students, and citizens, thronged the streets,
and pressed towards Abélard’s house on St. Genevieve. ‘Almost the
entire city,’ says Fulques, went clamouring towards his house:
‘women wept as though each one had lost her husband.’ Abélard had
been brutally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>
mutilated during the night. Hirelings of Canon Fulbert had corrupted
his valet, and entered his room whilst he slept. They had perpetrated
an indescribable outrage, such as was not infrequently inflicted in
the quarrels of the Patareni and the Nicolaitæ. In that dark night
the sunshine disappeared for ever from the life of Pierre Abélard.
Henceforth we have to deal with a new man.</p>

<p>It is a pious theory of the autobiographist himself that this
mutilation led indirectly to his ‘conversion.’ There is undoubtedly
much truth in this notion of an indirect occasioning of better
thoughts and of an indirect influence being cast on his mind for
life. Yet we of the later date, holding a truer view of the unity of
human nature, and of the place that sex-influence occupies in its
life, can see that the ‘conversion’ was largely a direct, physical
process. We have, in a very literal sense, another man to deal with
henceforward.</p>

<p>As Abélard lay on the bed of sickness, the conversion gradually
worked onwards towards a critical decision. It is not clear that the
mutilation would prove of itself an impediment to scholastic honour
or ecclesiastical office, but the old life could not be faced again
by one with so little strength and so keen a sensibility. ‘I<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span> pondered on the glory
I had won and on the swift chance blow that had obscured it, nay,
wholly extinguished it: on the just judgment of God by which I had
been punished in the member that had sinned: on the justice of
treachery coming from him whom I had myself betrayed: on the joy of
my rivals at such a humiliation: on the endless sorrow this wound
would inflict on my family and my friends: on the speed with which
this deep disgrace would travel through the world. What path was
open to me now? How could I ever walk abroad again, to be pointed at
by every finger, ridiculed by every tongue, a monstrous spectacle
to all?... In such sorry plight as I was, the confusion of shame
rather than a devout conversion impelled me to seek refuge in the
monastery.’</p>

<p>To this natural ‘confusion of shame’ we must look for an
explanation of, not merely the folly, but the cruelty and
selfishness, of Abélard’s proposal. It involved the burial of Heloise
in a nunnery. No one could shrink more feelingly from the unnatural
shade of the cloister than did Heloise, as Abélard must have known,
but in his pain and despair he forgot the elementary dictates of
love or of honour. In any other circumstances<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span> the act would be deemed brutal. Indeed,
he wantonly increased the suffering of his young wife by ordering
her to take the vows first. Twenty years afterwards she plaintively
tells him the sorrow he gave her by such a command. ‘God knows,’ she
says, ‘I should not have hesitated, at your command, to precede or to
follow you to hell itself.’ She was ‘profoundly grieved and ashamed’
at the distrust which seemed to be implied in his direction. But hers
was the love that ‘is stronger than death,’ and she complied without
a murmur, making of her sunny nature one more victim on the altar of
masculine selfishness.</p>

<p>Abélard has left us a dramatic picture of her taking the vows. It
shows clearly that the love which impelled her to such a sacrifice
was not the blind, child-like affection that is wholly merged in
the stronger loved one, but the deep, true love that sees the full
extent of the sacrifice demanded, and accepts it with wide-opened
eyes. At the last moment a little group of friends surrounded her
in the convent-chapel. The veil, blessed by the bishop, lay on the
altar before them, and they were endeavouring to dissuade her from
going forward to take it. She waved them aside—waved aside for the
last time the thought of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p.
123]</span> child and the vision of a sun-lit earth—and took the
fateful step towards the altar. Then, standing on the spot where
the young nun generally knelt for the final thanksgiving to God,
she recited with the tense fervour of a human prayer the words of
Cornelia in Lucan:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i14">‘O spouse most great,</p>
<p class="i0">O thou whose bed my merit could not share!</p>
<p class="i0">How hath an evil fortune worked this wrong</p>

  <p class="subh2">THE MONK OF ST. DENIS</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Abélard</span> had now entered
upon the series of blunders which were to make his life a succession
of catastrophes. A stronger man would have retired to Pallet, and
remained there until the discussion of his outrage had abated
somewhat; then boldly, and, most probably, with complete success,
have confronted the scholastic world once more, with his wife for
fitting companion, like Manegold of Alsace. In his distraction and
abnormal sense of humiliation, Abélard grasped the plausible promise
of the monastic life. In the second place, he, with a peculiar
blindness, chose the abbey of St. Denis for his home.</p>

<p>The abbey of St. Denis was not only one of the most famous
monasteries in Europe, but also a semi-religious, semi-secular
monarchical institution. It was the last monastery in the world
to provide that quiet seclusion which Abélard sought.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span> It lay about six miles
from Paris, near one of the many bends of the Seine on its journey to
the sea. Dagobert was its royal founder; its church was built over
the alleged bones of the alleged St. Denis the Areopagite, the patron
of France; it was the burial-place of the royal house. Over its altar
hung the oriflamme of St. Denis, the palladium of the country, which
the king came to seek, with solemn rite and procession, whenever
the cry of ‘St. Denis for France’ rang through the kingdom. Amongst
its several hundred monks were the physicians and the tutors of
kings—Prince Louis of France was even then studying in its school.</p>

<p>Rangeard, in his history of Brittany, says, that at the beginning
of the twelfth century there were more irregular than regular abbeys
in France. Abélard himself writes that ‘nearly all the monasteries’
of his time were worldly. The truth is that few monasteries, beside
those which had been very recently reformed, led a very edifying
life. Hence it is not surprising, when one regards the secular
associations of the place, to find that the Benedictine abbey of St.
Denis was in a very lax condition. Abélard soon discovered that,
as he says, it was an abbey ‘of very worldly<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span> and most disgraceful life.’ The great
rhetorician has a weakness for the use of superlatives, but other
witnesses are available. St. Bernard wrote of it, in his famed,
mellifluous manner, that it was certain the monks gave to Cæsar the
things that were Cæsar’s, but doubtful if they gave to God the things
that were God’s. A chronicler of the following century, Guillaume de
Nangis, writes that ‘the monks scarcely exhibited even the appearance
of religion.’</p>

<p>The abbey had not been reformed since 994, so that human nature
had had a considerable period in which to assert itself. The
preceding abbot, Ives <small>I.</small>, was accused at Rome of
having bought his dignity in a flagrant manner. The actual abbot,
Adam, is said by Abélard to have been ‘as much worse in manner
of life and more notorious than the rest as he preceded them in
dignity.’ It is certainly significant that the Benedictine historian
of the abbey, Dom Félibien, can find nothing to put to the credit
of Adam, in face of Abélard’s charge, except a certain generosity
to the poor. Nor have later apologists for the angels, de Nangis,
Duchesne, etc., been more successful. Ecclesiastical history only
finds consolation in the fact that Adam’s successor was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span> converted by Bernard in
1127, and at once set about the reform of the abbey.</p>

<p>When Abélard donned the black tunic of the Benedictine monk in
it, probably in 1119, the royal abbey was at the height of its gay
career. St. Bernard himself gives a bright picture of its life in one
of his letters. He speaks of the soldiers who thronged its cloisters,
the jests and songs that echoed from its vaulted roofs, the women
who contributed to its gaiety occasionally. From frequent passages
in Abélard we learn that the monks often held high festival. It may
be noted that monastic authorities nearly always give occasion to
these festivities, for, even in the severest rules, one always finds
an egg, or some other unwonted luxury, admitted on ‘feast-days.’ It
is the consecration of a principle that no body of men and women
on earth can apply and appreciate better than monks and nuns. The
feasts of St. Denis rivalled those of any château in gay France.
The monks were skilful at mixing wine—it is a well-preserved
monastic tradition—their farmer-vassals supplied food of the best
in abundance, and they hired plenty of conjurors, singers, dancers,
jesters, etc., to aid the task of digestion.</p>

<p>Nor was the daily life too dull and burdensome.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span> Royal councils were
frequently held at the abbey, and one does not need much acquaintance
with monastic life to appreciate that circumstance. Then there
was the school of the abbey, with its kingly and noble pupils—and
corresponding visitors: there was the continual stream of interesting
guests to this wealthiest and most famous of all abbeys: there was
the town of St. Denis, which was so intimately dependent on the
abbey. Above all, there were the country-houses, of which the abbey
had a large number, and from which it obtained a good deal of its
income. Some dying sinner would endeavour to corrupt the Supreme
Judge by handing over a farm or a château, with its cattle, and men
and women, and other commodities of value, to the monks of the great
abbey. These would be turned into snug little ‘cells’ or ‘priories,‘
and important sources of revenue. Sometimes, too, they had to be
fought for in the courts, if not by force of arms. Abélard complains
that ‘we [monks] compel our servants to fight duels for us’: he has
already complained of the frequent presentation to monasteries of
both man and maid servants. In 1111 we find some of the monks of St.
Denis, at the head of a small army, besieging the château of Puiset,
capturing its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span>
lieutenant, and casting him into a monastic prison. At Toury Abbot
Adam had his important dependence armed as a fortress, and made a
financial speculation in the opening of a public market. Rangeard
tells us, in addition, that many of the monks were expert in canon
law, and they travelled a good deal, journeying frequently to Rome in
connection with matrimonial and other suits.</p>

<p>But before Abélard turned his attention to the condition of the
abbey, he was long preoccupied with the thought of revenge. Revenge
was a branch virtue of justice in those days, and Abélard duly
demanded the punishment of <i>talio</i>. The valet, who had betrayed
him, and one of the mutilators, had been captured, and had lost
their eyes, in addition to suffering the same mutilation as they had
inflicted. But Abélard seems to have been painfully insistent on the
punishment of Fulbert. The matter belonged to the spiritual court,
since Abélard was a cleric, and Bishop Girbert does not seem to have
moved quickly enough for the new monk. Fulbert escaped from Paris,
and all his goods were confiscated, but this did not meet Abélard’s
(and the current) idea of justice. He began to talk of an appeal to
Rome.</p>

<p>In these circumstances was written the famous<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span> letter of Prior
Fulques, to which we have referred more than once. It is a
characteristic piece of mediæval diplomacy. Fulques was the prior
of Deuil, in the valley of Montmorency, a dependency of the abbey
of St. Florent de Saumur. He was apparently requested by the abbot
of St. Denis to persuade Abélard to let the matter rest. At all
events, he begins his letter with a rhetorical description of
Abélard’s success as a teacher, depicting Britons and Italians and
Spaniards braving the terrors of the sea, the Alps, and the Pyrenees,
under the fascination of Abélard’s repute. Then, with a view to
dissuading him from the threatened appeal to Rome, he reminds him
of his destitution and of the notorious avarice of Rome. There is
no reason why we should hesitate to accept Fulques’s assertion that
Abélard had no wealth to offer the abbey when he entered it. If, as
seems to be the more correct proceeding, we follow the opinion that
he spent the interval between the first withdrawal of Heloise and
the marriage with her at Pallet, he cannot have earned much during
the preceding two or three years. He was hardly likely to be a
provident and economical person. Most of whatever money he earned,
after he first began to serve up stale dishes<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span> to his students in the absorption of
his passion, would probably pass into the coffers of Fulbert or,
later, of the nunnery at Argenteuil. There is no need whatever to
entertain theories of licentiousness from that ground. We have,
moreover, already sufficiently discussed that portion of Fulques’s
letter.</p>

<p>But the second part of the prior’s argument, the avarice of
Rome, requires a word of comment. It is characteristic of the
ecclesiastical historian that in Migne’s version of Fulques’s
letter the indictment of Abélard is given without comment, and the
indictment of Rome is unblushingly omitted. It might be retorted that
such historians as Deutsch and Hausrath insert the indictment against
Rome, and make a thousand apologies for inserting the charge against
Abélard. The retort would be entirely without sting, since a mass
of independent evidence sustains the one charge, whilst the other
is at variance with evidence. The passage omitted in Migne, which
refers to Abélard’s proposal to appeal to Rome, runs as follows. ‘O
pitiful and wholly useless proposal! Hast thou never heard of the
avarice and the impurity of Rome? Who is wealthy enough to satisfy
that devouring whirlpool of harlotry? Who would ever be able to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span> fill their avaricious
purses? Thy resources are entirely insufficient for a visit to the
Roman Pontiff.... For all those who have approached that see in
our time without a weight of gold have lost their cause, and have
returned in confusion and disgrace.’</p>

<p>Let us, in justice, make some allowance for the exigency of
diplomacy and the purposes of rhetoric; the substance of the charge
is abundantly supported by other passages in Migne’s own columns. For
instance, Abbot Suger, in his <i>Vita Ludovici Grossi</i>, says of his
departure from Rome after a certain mission, ‘evading the avarice
of the Romans we took our leave.’ The same abbot speaks of their
astonishment at St. Denis when Paschal <small>II.</small> visited the
abbey in 1106: ‘contrary to the custom of the Romans, he not only
expressed no affection for the gold, silver, and precious pearls of
the monastery (about which much fear had been entertained),’ but
did not even look at them. It may be noted, without prejudice, that
Paschal was seeking the sympathy and aid of France in his quarrel
with Germany. In the apology of Berengarius, which is also found
in Migne, there is mention of ‘a Roman who had learned to love
gold, rather than God, in the Roman curia.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>’ Bernard of Cluny, a more respectable
witness, tersely informs us that ‘Rome gives to every one who gives
Rome all he has.’ Matthew of Paris is equally uncomplimentary. We
have spoken already of the licentious young Étienne de Garlande and
his proposal of going to Rome to buy the curia’s consent to his
installation in a bishopric; also of the rumour that Pope Paschal
disapproved, out of avarice, the censure passed on the adulterous
king. Duboulai, after giving Fulques’s letter, is content to say that
the pope feared too great an interference with the officials of the
curia on account of the papal schism.</p>

<p>Whether the letter of the monastic diplomatist had any weight
with Abélard or no, it seems that he did desist from his plan, and
laid aside all thought of Fulbert. But the unfortunate monk soon
discovered the disastrous error he had made in seeking peace at
the abbey of St. Denis. There had, in fact, been a serious mistake
on both sides. The monks welcomed one whom they only knew as a
lively, witty, interesting associate, a master of renown, a poet and
musician of merit. A new attraction would accrue to their abbey,
a new distraction to their own life, by the admission of Abélard.
The diversion of the stream of scholars<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> from Paris to St. Denis would bring
increased colour, animation, and wealth. The erudite troubadour and
brilliant scholar would be an excellent companion in the refectory,
when the silent meal was over, and the wine invited conversation.</p>

<p>They were rudely awakened to their error when Abélard began to
lash them with mordant irony for their ‘intolerable uncleanness.’
They found that the love-inspired songster was dead. They had
introduced a kind of Bernard of Clairvaux, a man of wormwood valleys,
into their happy abbey: a morose, ascetic, sternly consistent monk,
who poured bitter scorn on the strong wines and pretty maids, the
high festivals and pleasant excursions, with which the brothers
smoothed the rough path to Paradise. And when the gay Latin Quarter
transferred itself to St. Denis, and clamoured for the brilliant
master, Abélard utterly refused to teach. Abbot Adam gently
remonstrated with his ‘subject,’ pointing out that he ought now to
do more willingly for the honour of God and the sake of his brothers
in religion what he had formerly done out of worldly and selfish
interest. Whereupon Abbot Adam was urgently reminded of a few truths,
nearly con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>cerning
himself and ‘the brothers,’ which, if not new to his conscience, were
at least novel to his ears.</p>

<p>So things dragged on for a while, but Adam was forced at length
to rid the monastery of the troublesome monk. Finding a pretext in
the importunity of the students, he sent Abélard down the country
to erect his chair in one of the dependencies of the abbey. These
country-houses have already been mentioned. Large estates were left
to the abbey in various parts of the country. Monks had to be sent
to these occasionally, to collect the revenue from the farmers and
millers, and, partly for their own convenience, partly so that
they might return something in spiritual service to the district,
they built ‘cells’ or ‘oratories’ on the estates. Frequently the
cell became a priory; not infrequently it rebelled against the
mother-house; nearly always, as is the experience of the monastic
orders at the present day, it was a source of relaxation and
decay.</p>

<p>The precise locality of the ‘cell’ which was entrusted to
Brother Peter is matter of dispute, and the question need not delay
us. It was somewhere on the estates of Count Theobald of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span> Champagne, and
therefore not very far from Paris. Here Abélard consented to resume
his public lectures, and ‘gathered his horde of barbarians about him’
once more, in the jealous phrase of Canon Roscelin.</p>

<p>Otto von Freising relates that Abélard had now become ‘more
subtle and more learned than ever.’ There is no reason to doubt
that he continued to advance in purely intellectual power, but it
seems inevitable that he must have lost much of the brightness and
charm of his earlier manner. Yet his power and his fascination
were as great as ever. Maisoncelle, or whatever village it was,
was soon transformed into the intellectual centre of France. It
is said by some historians that three thousand students descended
upon the village, like a bewildering swarm of locusts. Abélard says
the concourse was so great that ‘the district could find neither
hospitality nor food’ for the students. One need not evolve from
that an army of several thousand admirers, but it seems clear that
there was a second remarkable gathering of students from all parts
of Christendom. There was no teacher of ability to succeed him at
Paris; he was still the most eminent master in Europe. Even if he had
lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span> a little of
the sparkle of his sunny years, no other master had ever possessed
it. Indeed, it is not audacious to think that the renewal of his
early success and the sweetness of life in lovely Champagne may have
in time quickened again such forces and graces of his character
as had not been physically eradicated. He began to see a fresh
potentiality of joy in life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Abélard, his perverse destiny had sent him down
to the neighbourhood of Rheims. It will be remembered that Anselm of
Laon was urged to suppress Abélard’s early theological efforts by
two of his fellow-pupils, Alberic of Rheims and Lotulphe of Novare.
Alberic appears to have been a man of ability, and he had been made
archdeacon of the cathedral, and head of the episcopal school, at
Rheims. He had associated Lotulphe with himself in the direction of
the schools, and they were teaching with great success when Abélard
appeared on the near horizon. Anselm of Laon and William of Champeaux
had gone, and the two friends were eager to earn the title of their
successors. The apparent extinction of Master Abélard had largely
increased their prestige, and had filled the school of Rheims.
Indeed, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span> gather
from the details of a ‘town and gown’ fight which occurred at Rheims
about this time that the students had almost come to outnumber the
citizens.</p>

<p>Hence it is not surprising that Abélard’s newfound peace was soon
disturbed by rumours of the lodging of complaints against him in
high quarters. The Archbishop of Rheims, Ralph the Green, began to
be assailed with charges. In the first place, he was reminded, it
was uncanonical for a monk to give lectures, and take up a permanent
residence, outside his monastery; moreover, the said monk was most
unmonastically engaged in reading Aristotle, with a flavour of
Vergil, Ovid, and Lucan. Raoul le Vert probably knew enough about
St. Denis not to attempt to force Abélard to return to it. Then the
grumblers—‘chiefly those two early intriguers,’ says the victim—urged
that Abélard was teaching without a ‘respondent’; but the archbishop
still found the pretext inadequate. Then, at length, came the second
great cloud, the accusation of heresy.</p>

<p>The convert had now made theology his chief object of study.
The students who gathered about him in his village priory loudly
demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> a
resumption of the lectures on dialectics and rhetoric, but Abélard
had really passed to a new and wholly religious outlook. He complied
with the request, only with a secret intention that, as he states
in the ‘Story,’ philosophy should be used as a bait in the interest
of divinity. The religious welfare of his followers now seriously
concerned him. It will be seen presently that he exercised a strict
control over their morals, and it was from the purest of motives
that he endeavoured, by a pious diplomacy, to direct their thoughts
to the study of Holy Writ. His rivals and enemies have attempted to
censure him for this casting of pearls before swine. Certainly there
were dangers accompanying the practice, but these were not confined
to Abélard’s school. We can easily conceive the disadvantage of
discussing the question, for instance, <i>utrum Maria senserit dolorem
vel delectationem in Christo concipiendo</i>? before a crowd of twelfth
century students. However, Abélard’s attitude was wholly reverent,
and his intention as pure as that of St. Anselm.</p>

<p>The one characteristic feature of Abélard’s theological work—the
feature which was constantly seized by his enemies, and which invests
him with so great an interest for the modern<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span> student—was his concern to conciliate
human reason. His predecessors had complacently affirmed that reason
had no title to respect in matters of faith. They insulted it with
such pious absurdities as ‘I believe in order that I may understand’
and ‘Faith goeth before understanding.’ Abélard remained until his
last hour constitutionally incapable of adopting that attitude. He
frequently attributes his obvious concern to meet the questioning
of reason to the desire of helping his followers. This is partly a
faithful interpretation of their thoughts—for which, however, he
himself was chiefly responsible—and partly a subtle projection of his
own frame of mind into his hearers. The development of the reasoning
faculty which was involved in so keen a study of dialectics was bound
to find expression in rationalism.</p>

<p>Abélard seems already to have written two works of a very
remarkable character for his age. One of these is entitled <i>A
Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian</i>. It may have
been founded on the <i>Octavius</i> of Minucius Felix; on the other hand
it may be classed with Lessing’s <i>Nathan</i>. It has been called ‘the
most radical expression of his rationalism,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span>’ and it would certainly seem to embody
his attitude during the period of his highest prosperity. The
ultimate victory lies with the Christian, so far as the work goes
(it is unfinished), but incidentally it shows more than one bold
departure from traditional formulæ. Abélard’s reluctance to consign
all the heathen philosophers to Tartarus would be highly suspect
to his pious contemporaries. It is a matter of faith in the Roman
Catholic Church to-day that no man shall enter heaven who has not a
belief in a personal God, at least; many theologians add the narrower
qualification of a literal acceptance of the Trinity. But Abélard
tempered his audacity by proving that his favourite heathens <i>had</i>
this qualification of a knowledge of the Trinity, probably under the
inspiration of St Augustine.</p>

<p>The <i>Dialogue</i> was not much assailed by his rivals; probably it
was not widely circulated. It is, however, an important monument
of Abélard’s genius. It anticipated not merely the rationalistic
attitude of modern theology, but also quite a number of the
modifications of traditional belief which modern rational and
ethical criticism has imposed. Abélard regards the ethical content
of Christianity, and finds that it is only the elabora<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>tion or the reformation
of the natural law, the true essence of religion. God has given this
essential gift in every conscience and in every religion; there are
no outcasts from the plan of salvation; the higher excellence of the
Christian religion lies in its clearer formulation of the law of
life. The popular notions of heaven and hell and deity are travesties
of true Christian teaching. God, as a purely spiritual being, is the
supreme good, and heaven is an approach to Him by obedience; hell,
isolation from Him. When we remember that Abélard had before him only
the works of the fathers and such recent speculations as those of
Anselm, we shall surely recognise the action of a mind of the highest
order in these debates.</p>

<p>The second work was not less remarkable. It was a collection of
sentences from the fathers on points of dogma. So far the compilation
would be an admirable one, but apart from the growing accusation that
Abélard was wanting in reverence for the authority of the fathers,
there was the suspicious circumstance that he had grouped these
eighteen hundred texts in contradictory columns. Thus one hundred
and fifty-eight questions are put by the compiler, relating<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span> to God, the Trinity,
the Redemption, the Sacraments, and so forth. The quotations from the
fathers are then arranged in two parallel columns, one half giving
an affirmative, and the rest a negative, answer to the question.
Such a work would be perfectly intelligible if it came from the pen
of a modern freethinker. Abélard’s <i>Sic et Non</i> (Yes and No), as
the work came to be called, has borne many interpretations. Such
careful and impartial students of Abélard’s work as Deutsch pronounce
the critical element in it to be ‘constructive, not sceptical.’
Most probably it was the intention of the compiler to shatter the
excessive regard of his contemporaries for the words of the fathers,
and thus to open the way for independent speculation on the deposit
of revelation (to which he thought he had as much right as Jerome or
Augustine), by making a striking exhibition of their fallibility.</p>

<p>Neither of these works seems to have fallen into the hands of
Alberic. Twenty years afterwards we find a theologian complaining
of the difficulty of obtaining some of Abélard’s works, which had
been kept secret. He probably refers to one or both of these works.
However that may be, Abélard wrote a third book during his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span> stay at Maisoncelle,
and on this the charge of heresy was fixed.</p>

<p>Wiser than the Church of those days, and anticipating the wisdom
of the modern Church of Rome, Abélard saw the great danger to the
faith itself of the Anselmian maxim, <i>Fides praecedit intellectum</i>.
He argued that, as the world had somehow outlived the age of
miracles, God must have intended rational evidence to take its place.
In any case, there was an increasingly large class of youths and men
who clamoured for ‘human and philosophic grounds,’ as he puts it,
who would lie to their consciences if they submitted to the current
pietism. Abélard believed he would render valuable service to the
Church if he could devise rational proofs, or at least analogies,
of its dogmas. It was in this frame of mind, not in a spirit of
destructive scepticism, that he raised the standard of rationalism.
He at once applied his force to the most preterrational of dogmas,
and wrote his famous <i>Treatise on the Unity and Trinity of God</i>.</p>

<p>A manuscript of the treatise was discovered by Stölzle a few years
ago. It is unnecessary to inflict on the reader an analysis of the
work. It is perfectly sincere and religious in intention, but,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span> like every book that
has ever been penned on the subject of the Trinity, it contains
illustrations which can be proved to be heretical. We may discuss the
point further apropos of the Council of Soissons.</p>

  <p class="subh2">THE TRIAL OF A HERETIC</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> swiftly multiplying
charges seem to have impaired Abélard’s health. He became much more
sensitive to the accusation of heresy than the mere injustice of it
can explain. We have an evidence of his morbid state at this period
in a letter he wrote to the Bishop of Paris. The letter must not be
regarded as a normal indication of the writer’s character, but, like
the letter of Canon Roscelin which it elicited, it is not a little
instructive about the age in which the writers lived. There are
hypercritical writers who question the correctness of attributing
these letters to Abélard and Roscelin, but the details they contain
refer so clearly to the two masters that any doubt about their origin
is, as Deutsch says, ‘frivolous and of no account’; he adds that
we should be only too glad, for the sake of the writers, if there
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> some firm
ground for contesting their genuineness.</p>

<p>A pupil of Abélard’s, coming down from Paris, brought him word
that Roscelin had lodged an accusation of heresy against him with
the bishop. As a monk of St. Denis, Abélard still belonged to
Bishop Girbert’s jurisdiction. Roscelin had himself been condemned
for heresy on the Trinity at Soissons in 1092, but his was an
accommodating rationalism; he was now an important member of the
chapter of St. Martin at Tours. Report stated that he had discovered
heresy in Abélard’s new work, and was awaiting the return of Girbert
to Paris in order to submit it to him. Abélard immediately grasped
the pen, and forwarded to Girbert a letter which is a sad exhibition
of ‘nerves.’ ‘I have heard,’ he says, after an ornate salutation of
the bishop and his clergy, ‘that that ever inflated and long-standing
enemy of the Catholic faith, whose manner of life and teaching are
notorious, and whose detestable heresy was proved by the fathers
of the Council of Soissons, and punished with exile, has vomited
forth many calumnies and threats against me, on account of the work
I have written, which was chiefly directed against his heresy.’ And
so the violent and exag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p.
148]</span>gerated account of Roscelin’s misdeeds continues. The
practical point of the epistle is that Abélard requests the bishop
to appoint a place and time for him to meet Roscelin face to face
and defend his work. The whole letter is marred by nervous passion
of the most pitiful kind. It terminates with a ridiculous, but
characteristic, dialectical thrust at the nominalist: ‘in that
passage of Scripture where the Lord is said to have eaten a bit of
broiled fish, he [Roscelin] is compelled to say that Christ ate, not
a part of the reality, but a part of the term “broiled fish.”’</p>

<p>Roscelin replied directly to Abélard, besides writing to Girbert.
The letter is no less characteristic of the time, though probably an
equally unsafe indication of the character of the writer. ‘If,’ it
begins, in the gentle manner of the time, ‘you had tasted a little of
that sweetness of the Christian religion which you profess by your
habit, you would not, unmindful of your order and your profession,
and forgetful of the countless benefits you received from my teaching
from your childhood to youth, have so far indulged in words of malice
against me as to disturb the brethren’s peace with the sword of the
tongue, and to contemn our Saviour’s most salutary and easy<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span> commands.’ He accepts,
with an equally edifying humility, Abélard’s fierce denunciation:
‘I see myself in your words as in a mirror. Yet God is powerful to
raise up out of the very stones,’ etc. But he cannot long sustain the
unnatural tone, and he suddenly collapses into depths of mediæval
Latin, which for filth and indecency rival the lowest productions of
Billingsgate. The venerable canon returns again and again, in the
course of his long letter, to Abélard’s mutilation, and with the art
of a Terence or a Plautus. As to the proposed debate, he is only too
eager for it. If Abélard attempts to shirk it at the last moment,
he ‘will follow him all over the world.’ He finally dies away in an
outburst of childish rage which beats Abélard’s peroration. He will
not continue any longer because it occurs to him that Abélard is, by
the strictest force of logic, a nonentity. He is not a monk, for he
is giving lessons; he is not a cleric, for he has parted with the
soutane; he is not a layman, for he has the tonsure; he is not even
the Peter he signs himself, for Peter is a masculine name.</p>

<p>These were the two ablest thinkers of Christendom at the time.
Fortunately for both, the battle royal of the dialecticians did not
take place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span>
Possibly Roscelin had not lodged the rumoured complaint at all. In
any case Girbert was spared a painful and pitiful scene.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards, however, Alberic and Lotulphe found an
excellent opportunity to take action. Some time in the year 1121
a papal legate, Conon, Bishop of Praeneste, came to Rheims. Conon
had been travelling in France for some years as papal legate, and
since it was the policy of Rome to conciliate France, in view of
the hostility of Germany, the legate had a general mission to make
himself as useful and obliging as possible. Archbishop Ralph, for his
part, would find it a convenient means of gratifying his teachers,
without incurring much personal responsibility. The outcome of their
conferences was, therefore, that Abélard received from the legate a
polite invitation to appear at a provincial synod, or council, which
was to be held at Soissons, and to bring with him his ‘celebrated
work on the Trinity.’ The simple monk was delighted at the apparent
opportunity of vindicating his orthodoxy. It was his first trial for
heresy.</p>

<p>When the time drew near for what Abélard afterwards called ‘their
conventicle,’ he set out for Soissons with a small band of friends,
who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> were to
witness the chastisement of Alberic and Lotulphe. But those astute
masters had not so naïve a view of the function of a council. Like
St. Bernard, with whom, indeed, they were already in correspondence,
they relied largely on that art of ecclesiastical diplomacy which
is the only visible embodiment of the Church’s supernatural power.
Moreover, they had the curious ecclesiastical habit of deciding that
an end—in this case, the condemnation of Abélard—was desirable, and
then piously disregarding the moral quality of the means necessary to
attain it. How far the two masters had arranged all the conditions
of the council we cannot say, but these certainly favoured their
plans.</p>

<p>Soissons, to begin with, was excellently suited for the holding
of a council which was to condemn, rather than investigate. Its
inhabitants would remember the sentence passed on Roscelin for a
like offence. In fact Longueval says, in his <i>Histoire de l’Église
Gallicane</i>, that the people of Soissons were religious fanatics as a
body, and had of their own impulse burned, or ‘lynched,’ a man who
was suspected of Manichæism, only a few years previously. Alberic
and Lotulphe had taken care to revive this pious instinct, by<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span> spreading amongst the
people the information that ‘the foreign monk,’ ‘the eunuch of St.
Denis,’ who was coming to the town to be tried, had openly taught the
error of tri-theism. The consequence was that when the Benedictine
monk appeared in the streets with his few admirers, he had a narrow
escape of being stoned to death by the excited citizens. It was a
rude shock to his dream of a great dialectical triumph.</p>

<p>On one point, however, Abélard’s simple honesty hit upon a
correct measure. He went straight to Bishop Conon with his work, and
submitted it for the legate’s perusal and personal judgment. The
politician was embarrassed. He knew nothing whatever about theology,
and would lose his way immediately in Abélard’s subtle analogies.
However, he bade Abélard take the book to the archbishop and the two
masters. They in turn fumbled it in silence, Abélard says, and at
length told him that judgment would be passed on it at the end of the
council.</p>

<p>Meantime Abélard had succeeded in correcting, to some extent, the
inspired prejudice of the townsfolk. Every day he spoke and disputed
in the streets and churches, before the council sat, and he tells us
that he seemed to make an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p.
153]</span> impression on his hearers. Alberic, in fact, came one day
with a number of his pupils for the purpose of modifying his rival’s
success; though he hurriedly retreated when it was shown that his
specially prepared difficulty had no force. Premising ‘a few polite
phrases,’ he pointed out that Abélard had denied that God generated
himself in the Trinity; for this statement, he carefully explained,
he did not ask reasons, but an authority. Abélard promptly turned
over the page, and pointed to a quotation from St. Augustine. It
was a swift and complete victory. But Abélard must needs improve
on it by accusing his accuser of heresy, and Alberic departed
‘like one demented with rage.’ Priests and people were now openly
asking whether the council had discovered the error to lie with
itself rather than with Abélard. They came to the last day of the
council.</p>

<p>Before the formal opening of the last session, the legate invited
the chief actors in the comedy (except Abélard) to a private
discussion of the situation. Conon’s position and attitude were
purely political. He cared little about their dialectical subtleties;
was, in fact, quite incompetent to decide questions of personality,
modality,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> and
all the rest. Still it was mainly a minor political situation he had
to deal with, and he shows an eagerness to get through it with as
little moral damage as possible. Ralph the Green, president of the
council, knew no more than Conon about theology; he also regarded it
as a political dilemma, and the prestige of his school would gain
by the extinction of Abélard. Ralph had nine suffragan bishops, but
only one of these is proved to have taken part in the ‘conventicle.’
It was Lisiard de Crespy, Bishop of Soissons, who would support his
metropolitan. Joscelin, an earlier rival of Abélard, was teaching
in Soissons at that time, and would most probably accompany his
bishop. Abbot Adam of St. Denis was present; so were Alberic and
Lotulphe. One man of a more worthy type sat with them, an awkward
and embarrassing spokesman of truth and justice, Geoffroi, Bishop of
Chartres, one of the most influential and most honourable members of
the French episcopacy.</p>

<p>Conon at once shrewdly introduced the formal question, what heresy
had been discovered in Abélard’s book? After his ill-success in the
street-discussion, Alberic seems to have hesitated to quote any
definite passage in the work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p.
155]</span> Indeed, we not only have two contradictory charges given,
but the texts which seem to have been used in this council to prove
the charge of tri-theism were quoted by the Council of Sens in 1141
in proof of an accusation of Sabellianism. Otto von Freising says
that Abélard held the three divine persons to be modifications of one
essence (the Anselmists claiming that the three were <i>realities</i>);
Abélard himself says he was accused of tri-theism. Every ‘analogy’
that has been found in the natural world for the dogma of the
Trinity, from the shamrock of St. Patrick to the triangle of
Père Lacordaire, exposes its discoverer to one or other of those
charges—for an obvious reason. After the death of Dr. Dale I remember
seeing a passage quoted by one of his panegyrists in illustration of
his singularly sound and clear presentation of dogma: it was much
more Sabellian than anything Abélard ever wrote.</p>

<p>However, the explicit demand of the legate for a specimen of
Abélard’s heresy was embarrassing. Nothing could be discovered in
the book to which Abélard could not have assigned a parallel in
the fathers. And when Alberic began to extort heresy by ingenious
interpreta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span>tion
Geoffroi de Lèves reminded them of the elementary rules of justice.
In the formal proceedings of a trial for heresy no one was condemned
unheard. If they were to anticipate the trial by an informal
decision, the requirement of justice was equally urgent. They must
give the accused an opportunity of defending himself. That was the
one course which Alberic dreaded most of all, and he so well urged
the magical power of Abélard’s tongue that the bishop’s proposal was
rejected. Geoffroi then complained of the smallness of the council,
and the injustice of leaving so grave and delicate a decision to a
few prelates. Let Abélard be given into the care of his abbot, who
should take him back to St. Denis and have him judged by an assembly
of expert theologians. The legate liked the idea. The Rheims people
regarded it, for the moment, as an effective removal of Abélard from
their neighbourhood. The proposal was agreed to, and the legate then
proceeded to say the Mass of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Meantime Archbishop Ralph informed Abélard of the decision.
Unsatisfactory as the delay was, he must have been grateful for
an escape from the power of Rheims. He turned indifferently<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span> from the further
session of the council. Unfortunately another conference was even
then taking place between Alberic, Ralph, and Conon; and Abélard was
presently summoned to bring his book before the council.</p>

<p>Alberic and Lotulphe were, on reflection, dissatisfied with the
result. Their influence would have no weight in a trial at Paris,
and their ambition required the sacrifice of the famous master. They
therefore went to the archbishop with a complaint that people would
take it to be a confession of incompetency if he allowed the case
to go before another court. The three approached the legate again,
and now reminded him that Abélard’s work was published without
episcopal permission, and could justly be condemned on that ground.
As ignorant of canon law as he was of theology, and seeing the
apparent friendlessness of Abélard, and therefore the security of a
condemnation, Conon agreed to their proposal.</p>

<p>Abélard had long looked forward to the hour of his appearance
before the Council. It was to be an hour of supreme triumph. The
papal legate and the archbishop in their resplendent robes in the
sanctuary; the circle of bishops and abbots and canons; the crowd
of priests, theologians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p.
158]</span> masters, and clerics; the solemn pulpit of the cathedral
church, from which he should make his highest effort of dialectics
and oratory; the scattered rivals, and the triumphant return to
his pupils. He had rehearsed it daily for a month or more. But the
sad, heart-rending reality of his appearance! He was brought in,
condemned. He stood in the midst of the thronged cathedral, with the
brand of heresy on his brow, he, the intellectual and moral master of
them all. A fire was kindled there before the Council. There was no
need for Geoffrey of Chartres to come, the tears coursing down his
cheeks, to tell him his book was judged and condemned. Quietly, but
with a fierce accusation of God Himself in his broken heart, as he
afterwards said, he cast his treasured work in the flames.</p>

<p>Even in that awful moment the spirit of comedy must needs assert
its mocking presence; or is it only part of the tragedy? Whilst the
yellow parchment crackled in the flames, some one who stood by the
legate muttered that one passage in it said that God the Father
alone was omnipotent. Soulless politician as he was, the ignorant
legate fastened on the charge as a confirmation of the justice
of his sentence. ‘I could scarcely believe<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> that even a child would fall into such
an error,’ said the brute, with an affectation of academic dignity.
‘And yet,’ a sarcastic voice fell on his ear, quoting the Athanasian
Creed, ‘and yet there are not Three omnipotent, but One.’ The bold
speaker was Tirric, the Breton scholastic, who, as we have seen,
probably instructed Abélard in mathematics. His bishop immediately
began to censure him for his neat exhibition of the legate’s
ignorance, but the teacher was determined to express his disgust at
the proceedings. ‘You have condemned a child of Israel,’ he cried,
lashing the ‘conventicle’ with the scornful words of Daniel, ‘without
inquiry or certainty. Return ye to the judgment seat, and judge the
judges.’</p>

<p>The archbishop then stepped forward to put an end to the
confusion. ‘It is well,’ he said, making a tardy concession to
conscience, ‘that the brother have an opportunity of defending his
faith before us all.’ Abélard gladly prepared to do so, but Alberic
and Lotulphe once more opposed the idea. No further discussion was
needed, they urged. The council had finished its work; Abélard’s
errors had been detected and corrected. If it were advisable to
have a profession of faith from Brother Peter, let him recite<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span> the Athanasian Creed.
And lest Abélard should object that he did not know the Creed by
heart, they produced a copy of it. The politic prelates were easily
induced to take their view. In point of fact the archbishop’s
proposal was a bare compliance with the canons. Abélard’s book
had been condemned on the ground that it had been issued without
authorisation; nothing had been determined as to the legitimacy of
its contents. The canons still demanded that he should be heard
before he was sent out into the world with an insidious stigma of
heresy.</p>

<p>But charity and justice had no part in that pitiful conventicle.
Archbishop and legate thought it politic to follow the ruling of
Alberic to the end, and the parchment was handed to Abélard. And
priest and prelate, monk and abbot, shamelessly stood around, whilst
the greatest genius of the age, devoted to religion in every gift of
his soul, as each one knew, faltered out the familiar symbol. ‘Good
Jesus, where wert thou?’ Abélard asks, long years afterwards. There
are many who ask it to-day.</p>

<p>So ended the holy Council of Soissons, Provincial Synod of the
arch-diocese of Rheims, held under the ægis of a papal legate, in the
year of grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>
1121. Its <i>acta</i> are not found in Richard, or Labbé, or Hefele: they
‘have not been preserved.’ There is an earlier ecclesiastical council
that earned the title of the <i>latrocinium</i> (‘rogues’ council’), and
we must not plagiarise. Ingenious and audacious as the apologetic
historian is, he has not attempted to defend the Council of Soissons.
But his condemnation of it is mildness itself compared with his
condemnation of Abélard.</p>

<p>For a crowning humiliation Abélard was consigned by the council
to a large monastery near Soissons, which served as jail or
penitentiary for that ecclesiastical province. The abbot of this
monastery, Geoffrey of the Stag’s-neck, had assisted at the council,
and Dom Gervaise would have it that he had secured Abélard for his
own purposes. He thinks the abbot was looking to the great legal
advantage, in the frequent event of a lawsuit, of having such an
orator as Abélard in his monastery. It is a possibility, like
many other details in Gervaise’s <i>Life of Abélard</i>. In forbidding
his return either to Maisoncelle or to St. Denis, and definitely
consigning him to the abbey of St. Médard, the council was once
more treating him as a legally convicted heretic. As far as it was
concerned, it was filling the chalice of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> poor monk’s bitterness. It is a mere
accident that Geoffrey was a man of some culture, and was so far
influenced by the hideous spectacle he had witnessed as to receive
Brother Peter with sympathy and some honour.</p>

  <p class="subh2">CLOUD UPON CLOUD</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> abbey of St. Médard,
to which Abélard accompanied his friendly jailer, was a very large
monastery on the right bank of the Aisne, just outside Soissons. At
that time it had a community of about four hundred monks. It derived
a considerable revenue from its two hundred and twenty farms, yet
it bore so high a repute for regular discipline that it had become
a general ‘reformatory school’ for the district. ‘To it were sent
the ignorant to be instructed, the depraved to be corrected, the
obstinate to be tamed,’ says a work of the time; though it is not
clear how Herr Hausrath infers from this that the abbey also served
the purpose of monastic asylum. For this character of penitentiary
the place was chosen for the confinement of Abélard. Thither he
retired to meditate on the joy and the wisdom of ‘conversion.’
‘God! How furiously did I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p.
164]</span> accuse Thee!’ he says of those days. The earlier wound
had been preceded, he admits, by his sin; this far deeper and
more painful wound had been brought upon him by his ‘love of our
faith.’</p>

<p>Whether Abbot Geoffrey thought Abélard an acquisition or no,
there was one man in authority at St. Médard who rejoiced with a
holy joy at his advent. This was no other than Abélard’s earlier
acquaintance, St. Goswin. The zealous student had become a monastic
reformer, and had recently been appointed Prior<a id="FNanchor_18"
href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of St. Médard. In
the recently reformed abbey, with a daily arrival of ‘obstinate
monks to be trained,’ and a convenient and well-appointed ascetical
armoury or whipping-room, the young saint was in a congenial element.
Great was his interest when ‘Pope Innocent,’<a id="FNanchor_19"
href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> as his biographers
say, ‘sent Abélard to be confined in the abbey, and, like an untamed
rhinoceros, to be caught in the bonds of discipline.’ Abélard was
not long in the abbey before the tamer approached this special task
that Providence had set him. We can imagine Abélard’s feelings<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span> when the obtuse monk
took him aside, and exhorted him ‘not to think it a misfortune or an
injury that he had been sent there; he was not so much confined in a
prison, as protected from the storms of the world.’ He had only to
live piously, and set a good example, and all would be well. Abélard
was in no mood to see the humour of the situation. He peevishly
retorted that ‘there were a good many who talked about piety and did
not know what piety was.’ Then the prior, say his biographers, saw
that it was not a case for leniency, but for drastic measures. ‘Quite
true,’ he replied, ‘there are many who talk about piety, and do not
know what it is. But if we find you saying or doing anything that is
not pious, we shall show you that we know how to treat its contrary,
at all events.’ The saint prevailed once more—in the biography: ‘the
rhinoceros was cowed, and became very quiet, more patient under
discipline, more fearful of the lash, and of a saner and less raving
mind.’</p>

<p>Fortunately, the boorish saint had a cultured abbot, one at
least who did not hold genius to be a diabolical gift, and whose
judgment of character was not wholly vitiated by the crude<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> mystic and monastic
ideal of the good people of the period. The abbot seems to have
saved Abélard from the zeal of the prior, and possibly he found
companionable souls amongst the four hundred monks of the great
abbey, some of whom were nobles by birth. We know, at all events,
that in the later period he looked back on the few months spent at
St. Médard with a kindly feeling.</p>

<p>His imprisonment did not last long. When the proceedings of the
council were made known throughout the kingdom, there was a strong
outburst of indignation. It must not be supposed that the Council
of Soissons illustrates or embodies the spirit of the period or the
spirit of the Church; this feature we shall more nearly find in the
Council of Sens, in 1141. The conventicle had, in truth, revealed
some of the evils of the time: the danger of the Church’s excessively
political attitude and administration, the brutality of the spirit
it engendered with regard to heresy, the fatal predominance of dogma
over ethic. But, in the main, the conventicle exhibits the hideous
triumph of a few perverse individuals, who availed themselves of all
that was crude and ill-advised in the machinery of the Church.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span> When, therefore,
such men as Tirric, and Geoffrey of Chartres, and Geoffrey of the
Stag’s-neck, spread their story abroad, there were few who did not
sympathise with Abélard. The persecutors soon found it necessary to
defend themselves; there was a chaos of mutual incriminations. Even
Alberic and Lotulphe tried to cast the blame on others. The legate
found it expedient to attribute the whole proceeding openly to
‘French malice.’ He had been ‘compelled for a time to humour their
spleen,’ as Abélard puts it, but he presently revoked the order of
confinement in St. Médard, and gave Abélard permission to return to
St. Denis.</p>

<p>It was a question of Scylla or Charybdis, of Prior Goswin or Abbot
Adam. The legate seems to have acted in good faith in granting the
permission—perhaps we should say in good policy, for he again acted
out of discreet regard for circumstances; but when we find Abélard
availing himself of what was no more than a permission to return
to St. Denis we have a sufficient indication of the quality of his
experience at St. Médard. He does indeed remark that the monks of the
reformed abbey had been friendly towards him, though this is inspired
by an obvious comparison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p.
168]</span> with his later experience at St. Denis. But St. Médard
was a prison; that sufficed to turn the scale. A removal from the
penitentiary would be equivalent, in the eyes of France, to a
revocation of the censure passed on him. So with a heart that was
hopelessly drear, not knowing whether to smile or weep, he went back,
poor sport of the gods as he was, to the royal abbey.</p>

<p>For a few months Brother Peter struggled bravely with the
hard task the fates had set him. He was probably wise enough to
refrain from inveighing, in season and out of season, against the
‘intolerable uncleanness’ of Adam and his monks. Possibly he nursed
a hope—or was nursed by a hope—of having another ‘cell’ entrusted
to his charge. In spite of the irregularity of the abbey, formal
religious exercises were extensively practised. All day and night the
chant of the breviary was heard in the monastic chapel. There was
also a large and busy <i>scriptorium</i>; the <i>archivium</i> of the ancient
abbey was a treasury of interesting old documents; and there was a
relatively good library. It was in the latter that Brother Peter
found his next adventure, and one that threatened to be the most
serious of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span></p>

<p>Seeing the present futility of his theological plans, he had
turned to the study of history. There was a copy of Bede’s <i>History
of the Apostles</i> in the library, and he says that he one day, ‘by
chance,’ came upon the passage in which Bede deals with St. Denis.
The Anglo-Saxon historian would not admit the French tradition about
St. Denis. He granted the existence of a St. Denis, but said that
he had been Bishop of Corinth, not of Athens. The legend about the
martyrdom of Denis the Areopagite, with his companions Rusticus and
Eleutherius, at Paris in the first century, is now almost universally
rejected by Roman Catholic historians, not to mention others. It is,
however, still enshrined with honour in that interesting compendium
of myths of the Christian era, the Roman breviary, and is read with
religious solemnity by every priest and every monastic choir in the
Catholic world on the annual festival.</p>

<p>However, the abbey of St. Denis, the monastery that owed all its
wealth and repute to its possession of the bones of ‘the Areopagite,’
was the last place in the world in which to commence a rationalistic
attack on the legend. With his usual want of tact and foresight
Brother Peter showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p.
170]</span> the passage in Bede to some of his fellow-monks, ‘in
joke,’ he says; he might as well have cut the abbot’s throat, or
destroyed the wine-cellar ‘in joke.’ There was a violent commotion.
Heresy about the Trinity was bad, but heresy about the idol of the
royal abbey was more touching. It is not quite clear that Abélard
came to the opinion of modern religious historians, that the St.
Denis of Paris was a much later personage than the Areopagite of the
Acts of the Apostles, but he seems to hold that opinion. In any case,
the monks felt that to be the substance of his discovery, and held
it to be an attack on the glory of the abbey. Venerable Bede was,
they bluntly replied, a liar. One of their former abbots, Hilduin,
had made a journey to Greece for the special purpose of verifying the
story.</p>

<p>When the monks flew to Abbot Adam with the story of Brother
Peter’s latest outbreak, Adam saw in it an opportunity of terrifying
the rebel into submission, if not of effectually silencing him.
He called a chapter of the brethren. One’s pen almost tires
of describing the cruel scenes to which those harsh days lent
themselves. The vindictive abbot perched on his high chair,
prior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> and elder
brethren sitting beside him; the hundreds of black-robed, shaven
monks lining the room; on his knees in the centre the pale, nervous
figure of the Socrates of Gaul. With a mock solemnity, Abbot Adam
delivers himself of the sentence. Brother Peter has crowned his
misdeeds, in his pride of mind, with an attack, not merely on the
abbey that sheltered him, but on the honour and the safety of France.
The matter is too serious to be punished by even the most severe
methods at the command of the abbey. Brother Peter is to be handed
over to the king, as a traitor to the honour of the country. The poor
monk, now thoroughly alarmed, abjectly implores the abbot to deal
with him in the usual way. Let him be scourged—anything to escape the
uncertain temper of King Louis. No, the abbey must be rid of him.
He is taken away into confinement, with an injunction that he be
carefully watched until it is convenient to send him to Paris.</p>

<p>There were, however, some of the monks who were disgusted at the
savage proceeding. A few days afterwards he was assisted to escape
from the monastic dungeon during the night, and, ‘in utter despair,’
he fled from the abbey, with a few of his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span> former pupils. It was, in truth, a
desperate move. As a deserter from the abbey, the canons required
that two stalwart brothers should be sent in pursuit of him, and
that he be reimprisoned. As a fugitive from the king’s justice, to
which he had been publicly destined, he was exposed to even harsher
treatment. However, he made his way into Champagne once more, and
threw himself on the mercy of his friends.</p>

<p>One of the friends whom he had attached to himself during his stay
at Maisoncelle was prior of St. Ayoul, near the gates of Provins.
It was a priory belonging to the monks of Troyes, and both Hatton,
Bishop of Troyes, and Theobald, Count of Champagne, were in sympathy
with the fugitive. The prior, therefore, received Abélard into his
convent, to afford at least time for reflection. His condition,
however, was wholly uncanonical, and the prior, as well as the abbot
of St. Peter of Troyes, urged him to secure some regularity for his
absence from St. Denis, so that they might lawfully shelter him at
St. Ayoul. Abélard summoned what diplomatic faculty he had, and wrote
to St. Denis.</p>

<p>‘Peter, monk by profession and sinner by his deeds, to his dearly
beloved father, Adam, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p.
173]</span> his most dear brethren and fellow-monks,’ was the
inscription of the epistle. Brother Peter, it must be remembered,
was fighting almost for life; and he was not of the heroic stuff
of his friend and pupil, Arnold of Brescia. There are critics who
think he descended lower than this concession to might, that he
deliberately denied his conviction for the purpose of conciliating
Adam. Others, such as Poole, Deutsch, and Hausrath, think the letter
does not support so grave a censure. The point of the letter is
certainly to convey the impression that Bede had erred, and that
Abélard had no wish to urge his authority against the belief of
the monks. In point of fact, Bede is at variance with Eusebius and
Jerome, and it is not impossible that Abélard came sincerely to
modify the first impression he had received from Bede’s words; in the
circumstances, and in the then state of the question, this would not
be unreasonable. At the same time a careful perusal of the letter
gives one the impression that it is artistic and diplomatic; that
Abélard has learned tact, rather than unlearned history. It reads
like an effort to say something conciliatory about St. Denis, without
doing serious violence to the writer’s conscience. Perhaps the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span> abbot of St. Peter’s
could have thrown some light on its composition.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Abbot Adam came to visit Count Theobald, and
Abélard’s friends made a direct effort to conciliate him. The prior
of St. Ayoul and Abélard hurried to the count’s castle, and begged
him to prevail upon his guest to release Abélard from his obedience.
The count tried to persuade Adam to do so, but without success.
Adam seemed determined, not so much to rid his happy convent of a
malcontent, as to crush Abélard. He found plenty of pious garbs to
cover his vindictiveness with. At first he deprecated the idea that
it was a matter for his personal decision. Then, after a consultation
with the monks who accompanied him, he gravely declared that it was
inconsistent with the honour of the abbey to release Abélard; ‘the
brethren had said that, whereas Abélard’s choice of their abbey had
greatly redounded to its glory, his flight from it had covered them
with shame.’ He threatened both Abélard and the prior of St. Ayoul
with the usual canonical penalties, unless the deserter returned
forthwith to obedience.</p>

<p>Adam’s departure, after this fulmination, left<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span> Abélard and his friends
sadly perplexed. The abbot had the full force of canon law on his
side, and he was evidently determined to exact his pound of flesh.
However, whilst they were busy framing desperate resolves, they
received information of the sudden death of Abbot Adam. He died a
few days after leaving Champagne, on the 19th of February 1122. The
event brought relief from the immediate pressure. Some time would
elapse before it would be necessary to resume the matter with Adam’s
successor, and there was room for hope that the new abbot would not
feel the same personal vindictiveness.</p>

<p>The monk who was chosen by the Benedictines of St. Denis to
succeed Adam was one of the most remarkable characters of that
curious age. Scholar, soldier, and politician, he had an enormous
influence on the life of France during the early decades of the
twelfth century. Nature intended him for a minister and a great
soldier: chance made him a monk; worldly brothers made him an abbot,
and St. Bernard completed the anomaly by ‘converting’ him in 1127.
At the time we are speaking of he was the more active and prominent
of two men whom Bernard called ‘the two calamities of the Church of
France.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span>’ He was
born of poor parents, near one of the priories or dependencies of
St. Denis. His talent was noticed by the monks, and his ‘vocation’
followed as a matter of course. He was studying in the monastic
school when King Philip brought his son Louis to St. Denis, and the
abbot sent for him, and made him companion to the royal pupil. He
thus obtained a strong influence over the less gifted prince, and
when Louis came to the throne in 1108, Suger became the first royal
councillor. Being only a deacon in orders, there was nothing to
prevent him heading the troops, directing a campaign, or giving his
whole time to the affairs of the kingdom. He had proved so useful
a minister that, when some of the monks of St. Denis came in great
trepidation to tell the king they had chosen him for abbot, they
were angrily thrust into prison. Suger himself was in Rome at the
time, discharging a mission from the king, and he tells us, in his
autobiography, of the perplexity the dilemma caused him. However,
before he reached France, the king had concluded that an abbot could
be as useful as a prior in an accommodating age. In the sequel, St.
Denis became more royal, and less abbatial than ever—until 1127. St.
Bernard complained that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p.
177]</span> seemed to have become the ‘war office’ and the ‘ministry
of justice’ of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Abélard now seems to have been taken in hand by a more astute
admirer, Burchard, Bishop of Meaux. They went to Paris together, and
apparently did a little successful diplomacy before the arrival and
consecration of Suger. The newly created abbot (he had been ordained
priest the day before his consecration) refused to undo the sentence
of his predecessor. He was bound by the decision of the abbey, he
said; in other words, there was still a strong vindictive feeling
against Abélard in the abbey, which it was not politic to ignore. It
is quite impossible that Suger himself took the matter seriously.</p>

<p>But before Suger’s arrival Abélard and his companions had made
friends at court. Whether through his pupils, many of whom were
nobles, or through his family, is unknown, but Abélard for the
second time found influence at court when ecclesiastical favour was
denied. One of the leading councillors was Étienne de Garlande,
the royal seneschal, and means were found to interest him in the
case of the unfortunate monk. We have already seen that Stephen
had ecclesiastical ambition in his earlier years, and had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span> become a deacon and
a canon of Étampes. But when his patron, King Philip, submitted to
the Church and to a better ideal of life, Stephen concluded that the
path to ecclesiastical dignities would be less smooth and easy for
the ‘illiterate and unchaste,’ and he turned to secular ambition. At
the time of the events we are reviewing he and Suger were the virtual
rulers of France; from the ecclesiastical point of view he was the
man whom St. Bernard associated with Suger as ‘a calamity of the
Church.’</p>

<p>‘Through the mediation of certain friends’ Abélard had enlisted
the interest of this powerful personage, and the court was soon known
to favour his suit. There are many speculations as to the motive of
the king and his councillors in intervening in the monastic quarrel.
Recent German historians see in the incident an illustration of a
profound policy on the part of the royal council. They think the king
was then endeavouring to strengthen his authority by patronising
the common people in opposition to the tyrannical and troublesome
nobility. Following out a parallel policy with regard to the Church,
whose nobles were equally tyrannical and troublesome, Stephen and
Suger would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span>
naturally befriend the lower clergy in opposition to the prelates.
Hence the royal intervention on behalf of the monk of St. Denis is
associated with the intervention on the side of the peasantry a few
years before.</p>

<p>The theory is ingenious, but hardly necessary. Abélard says that
the court interfered because it did not desire any change in the
free life of the royal abbey, and consequently preferred to keep him
out of it. That is also ingenious, and complimentary to Abélard. But
it is not a little doubtful whether anybody credited him with the
smallest influence at St. Denis. We shall probably not be far from
the truth if we suppose a court intrigue on the monk’s behalf which
his friends did not think it necessary to communicate fully to him.
Geoffrey of Chartres and other friends of his were French nobles.
Many of his pupils had that golden key which would at any time give
access to Étienne de Garlande.</p>

<p>In any case Stephen and Suger had a private discussion of
the matter, and the two politicians soon found a way out of the
difficulty. Abélard received an order to appear before the king
and his council. The comedy—though it was no<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span> comedy for Abélard—probably took place
at St. Denis. Louis the Fat presided, in robes of solemn purple,
with ermine border. Étienne de Garlande and the other councillors
glittered at his side. Abbot Suger and his council were there to
defend the ‘honour’ of the abbey; and Brother Peter, worn with
anxiety and suffering, came to make a plea for liberty. Louis bids
the abbot declare what solution of the difficulty his chapter has
discovered. Suger gravely explains that the honour of their abbey
does not permit them to allow the fugitive monk to join any other
monastery. So much to save the face of the abbey. Yet there is a
middle course possible, the abbot graciously continues: Brother Peter
may be permitted to live a regular life in the character of a hermit.
Brother Peter expresses his satisfaction at the decision—it was
precisely the arrangement he desired—and departs from the abbey with
his friends, a free man once more, never again, he thinks, to fall
into the power of monk or prelate.</p>

  <p class="subh2">BACK TO CHAMPAGNE</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> scene of the next act
in Abélard’s dramatic career is a bright, restful valley in the heart
of Champagne. It is the summer of 1122, and the limpid Arduzon rolls
through enchantingly in its course towards the Seine. In the meadow
beside it are two huts and a small oratory, rudely fashioned from
the branches of trees and reeds from the river, and daubed over with
mud. No other sign of human presence can be seen. Abélard and one
companion are the only human beings to be found for miles. And even
all thought of the cities of men and the sordid passions they shelter
is arrested by the great forests of oak and beech which hem in the
narrow horizon and guard the restfulness of the valley.</p>

<p>By the terms of Suger’s decision Abélard could neither lodge with
secular friends nor enter any cell, priory, or abbey. Probably this
coercion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span> into
leading an eremitical life was unnecessary. The experience of the
last three years had made a hermitage of his heart; nothing would
be more welcome to him than this quiet valley. It was a spot he had
noticed in earlier years. In his ancient chronicle Robert of Auxerre
says that Abélard had lived there before; Mr. Poole thinks it was to
the same part of Champagne that he resorted on the three occasions of
his going to the province of Count Theobald. That would at least have
to be understood in a very loose sense. On the two former occasions
he had found a home prepared, a cell and a priory, respectively; he
had now to build a hut with his own hands. It was a deserted spot he
had chosen, he tells us; and Heloise adds, in one of her letters,
that before Abélard’s coming it had been the haunt of robbers and
the home of foxes and wild boars, like the neighbouring forest of
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Abélard must have seen this quiet side-valley in passing along
the Seine on the road to Paris. It was some twelve miles from
Troyes, where he had a number of friends; and when he expressed a
desire to retire to it with his companion, they obtained for him the
gift of the meadow through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p.
183]</span> which the Arduzon ran. Bishop Hatton gave them permission
to build an oratory, and they put together a kind of mud hut—‘in
honour of the Blessed Trinity’! Here the heavy heart began once
more to dream of peace. Men had tortured him with a caricature of
the divine justice when his aim and purpose had been of the purest.
He had left their ignorant meddlesomeness and their ugly passions
far away beyond the forests. Alone with God and with nature in her
fairest mood, he seemed to have escaped securely from an age that
could not, or would not, understand his high ideal.</p>

<p>So for some time no sound was heard in the valley but the song
of the birds and the grave talk of the two hermits and the frequent
chant in the frail temple of the Trinity. But Abélard’s evil genius
was never far from him; it almost seems as if it only retired just
frequently enough and long enough to let his heart regain its full
power of suffering. The unpractical scholar had overlooked a material
point, the question of sustenance. Beech-nuts and beech-leaves and
roots and the water of the river become monotonous. Abélard began to
cast about for some source of revenue. ‘To dig I was not able, to beg
I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> ashamed,’
he says, in the familiar words. There was only one thing he could
do—teach.</p>

<p>Probably he began by giving quiet lessons to the sons of his
neighbours. He had only to let his intention be known in Troyes, and
he would have as many pupils as he desired. But he soon found that,
as was inevitable, he had released a torrent. The words in which he
describes this third confluence of his streams of ‘barbarians’ do
not give us the impression that he struggled against his fate. With
all his genius he remained a Breton—short of memory and light of
heart. The gladdening climate of mid-France and the brightness and
beauty of the valley of the Seine quickened his old hopes and powers.
The word ran through the kingdoms of Gaul, and across the sea and
over the southern hills, that Abélard was lecturing once more. And
many hundreds, probably thousands, of youths gathered their scant
treasures, and turned their faces towards the distant solitude of
Nogent-sur-Seine.</p>

<p>Then was witnessed a scene that is quite unique in the annals
of education. Many centuries before, the deserts of Egypt had
seen a vast crowd of men pour out from the cities, and rush
eagerly into their thankless solitude. That<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span> was under the fresh-born influence of
a new religious story, the only force thought competent to inspire
so great an abdication. The twelfth century saw another great stream
of men pouring eagerly into a solitude where there was no luxury but
the rude beauty of nature. Week by week the paths that led into the
valley by the Arduzon discharged their hundreds of pilgrims. The
rough justice of nature offered no advantage to wealth. Rich and
poor, noble and peasant, young and old, they raised their mud-cabins
or their moss-covered earth-works, each with his own hand. Hundreds
of these rude dwellings dotted the meadow and sheltered in the wood.
A bundle of straw was the only bed to be found in them. Their tables
were primitive mounds of fresh turf; the only food a kind of coarse
peasant-bread, with roots and herbs and a draught of sweet water from
the river. The meats and wines and pretty maids and soft beds of the
cities were left far away over the hills. For the great magician had
extended his wand once more, and the fascination of his lectures was
as irresistible as ever.</p>

<p>They had built a new oratory, in wood and stone, for the loved
master; and each morning, as the full blaze of the sun fell upon the
strangely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span> scarred
face of the valley, they arose from the hay and straw, splashed or
dipped in the running river, and trooped to the spot where Abélard
fished for their souls with the charming bait of his philosophy. Then
when the master tired of reading Scripture, and of his pathetic task
of finding analogies of the infinite in the finite, they relaxed to
such games and merriment as youth never leaves behind.</p>

<p>Discipline, however, was strict. There is a song, composed at
the time by one of the pupils, which affords an instructive glimpse
of the life of the strange colony. Some one seems to have informed
Abélard of a group of students who were addicted to the familiar
vice. He at once banished them from the colony, threatening to
abandon the lectures unless they retired to Quincey. The poet of the
group was an English youth, named Hilary, who had come to France a
little before. Amongst his <i>Versus et ludi</i>, edited by Champollion,
we find his poetic complaint of the falseness of the charge and the
cruelty of their expulsion. It is a simple, vigorous, rhymed verse
in Latin, with a French refrain. It is obviously intended to be sung
in chorus, and it thus indirectly illustrates one of the probable
recreations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span>
of the youths who were thus thrown upon their own resources. Many
another of Hilary’s rough songs must have rung through the valley at
nightfall. Perhaps Abélard recovered his old gift, and contributed
to the harmless gaiety of the colony. Seared and scarred as he
was, there was nothing sombre or sour about his piety, save in the
moments of actual persecution. With all his keen and living faith
and his sense of remorse, he remains a Breton, a child of the
sun-light, sensitive to the gladdening force of the world. Not until
his last year did he accept the ascetic view of pleasures which
were non-ethical. Watchful over the faith and morals of the colony,
he would make no effort to moderate the loud song with which they
responded to the warm breath of nature.</p>

<p>The happiness of his little world surged in the heart of the
master for a time, but nature gave him a capacity for, and a taste
of, manifold happiness, only that he might suffer the more. ‘I had
one enemy—echo,’ he says in his autobiography. He was soon made
uneasily conscious that the echo of his teaching and the echo of the
glad life of the colony had reached Clairvaux.</p>

<p>The first definite complaint that reached his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> ears referred to the
dedication of his oratory. Though formally dedicated to the Trinity,
it was especially devoted to the Holy Spirit, in the character of
Paraclete (Comforter); indeed both it and the later nunnery were
known familiarly as ‘the Paraclete.’ Some captious critics had,
it appears, raised a question whether it was lawful to dedicate
a chapel to one isolated member of the Trinity. The question was
absurd, for the Church frequently offers worship to the Holy Spirit,
without mentioning the Father and the Son. The cautious Abélard,
however, defends his dedication at great length. A second attack
was made under the pretext of questioning the propriety of an image
of the Trinity which was found in the oratory. Some sculptor in
the colony had endeavoured to give an ingenious representation of
the Trinity in stone. He had carved three equal figures from one
block of stone, and had cut on them inscriptions appropriate to
each Person of the Trinity.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Such devices were common in the Church,
common in all Trinitarian religions, in fact. But Abélard was
credited with intentions and interpretations in everything he did.
Neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span> of these
incidents proved serious, however. It was not until Abélard heard
that Alberic and Lotulphe were inciting ‘the new apostles’ to assail
him that he became seriously alarmed. The new apostles were Bernard
of Clairvaux and Norbert of Prémontré.</p>

<p>Not many leagues from the merry valley on the Arduzon was another
vale that had been peopled by men from the cities. It was a dark,
depressing valley, into which the sun rarely struggled. The Valley of
Wormwood men called it, for it was in the heart of a wild, sombre,
chilly forest. The men who buried themselves in it were fugitives,
not merely from the hot breath of the cities and the ugly deeds of
their fellows, but even from the gentler inspiration of nature, even
from its purest thrills. They had had a vision of a golden city, and
believed it was to be entered by the path of self-torture. The narrow
windows of their monastery let in but little of the scanty light of
the valley. With coarse bread and herbs, and a few hours’ sleep on
boxes of dried leaves, they made a grudging concession to the law of
living. But a joke was a sacrilege in the Valley of Wormwood, and a
song a piece of supreme folly. The only sound that told the ravens
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span> the owls of
the presence of man was the weird, minor chant for hours together,
that did not even seem to break the silence of the sombre spot. By
day, the white-robed, solemn shades went about their work in silence.
The Great Father had made the pilgrimage to heaven so arduous a task
that they dare not talk by the wayside.</p>

<p>Foremost among them was a frail, tense, absorbed, dominant little
man. The face was white and worn with suffering, the form enfeebled
with disease and exacting nervous exaltation; but there was a light
of supreme strength and of joy in the penetrating eyes. He was a man
who saw the golden city with so near, so living a vision, that he was
wholly impatient of the trivial pleasures of earth: a man formed in
the mould of world-conquerors and world-politicians, in whose mind
accident had substituted a supernatural for a natural ideal: a man of
such intensity and absorption of thought that he was almost incapable
of admitting a doubt as to the correctness of his own judgment and
purpose and the folly of all that was opposed to it: a man in whom
an altruistic ethic might transform, or disguise, but could never
suppress, the demand of the entire nature for self-assertion. This
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span> Bernard of
Clairvaux, who had founded the monastery in the deepest poverty ten
years before. He was soon to be the most powerful man in Christendom.
And he held that, if the instinct of reasoning and the impulse of
love did indeed come from God and not from the devil, they were of
those whimsical gifts, such as the deity of the Middle Ages often
gave, which were given with a trust they would be rejected.</p>

<p>The other new apostle was St. Norbert, the founder of the
Premonstratensian canons. He had fruitlessly endeavoured to reform
the existing order of canons, and had then withdrawn to form a kind
of monastery of canons at Prémontré, not far from Laon, where he
occasionally visited Anselm. His disciples entered zealously into
the task of policeing the country. No disorder in faith or morals
escaped their notice; and although Norbert was far behind Bernard
in political ability, the man who incurred his pious wrath was in
an unenviable position. He had influence with the prelates of the
Church, on account of his reforms and the sanctity of his life; he
had a profound influence over the common people, not only through his
stirring sermons, but also through the miracles he wrought. Abélard
frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> bases
his rationalistic work on the fact, which he always assumes to be
uncontroverted, that the age of miracles is over. Norbert, on the
contrary, let it be distinctly understood that he was a thaumaturgus
of large practice. Abélard ridiculed his pretensions, and the stories
told of him. Even in his later sermons we find him scornfully
‘exposing’ the miracles of Norbert and his companions. They used to
slip medicaments unobserved into the food of the sick, he says, and
accept the glory of the miracle if the fever was cured. They even
attempted to raise the dead to life; and when the corpse retained
its hideous rigidity after they had lain long hours in prayer in the
sanctuary, they would turn round on the simple folk in the church and
upbraid them for the littleness of their faith. This poor trickery
was the chief source of the power of the Premonstratensian canons
over the people. Abélard could not repose and ridicule it with
impunity.</p>

<p>These were the new apostles—‘pseudo-apostles’ Heloise calls
them—whom Alberic and Lotulphe now incited to take up the task which
they themselves dared pursue no longer. And so, says Abélard, ‘they
heaped shameless calumnies on me at every opportunity, and for some
time brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span>
much discredit upon me in the eyes of certain ecclesiastical as well
as secular dignitaries.’ We shall find that, when Abélard stands
before the ecclesiastical tribunal a second time, many of his earlier
friends have deserted him, and have fallen under the wide-reaching
influence of St. Bernard.</p>

<p>But it is strenuously denied by prejudiced admirers of St.
Bernard that he had anything to do with Abélard at this period.
Father Hefele, for instance, thinks that Abélard is guilty of some
chronological confusion in the passage quoted above; looking back on
the events of his life, he has unconsciously transferred the later
activity of Bernard to the earlier date, not clearly separating it
in time from the work of Alberic and Norbert. Unfortunately, the
‘Story of my Calamities’ was written <i>before</i> Bernard commenced his
open campaign against Abélard. We shall see later that this is beyond
dispute. There is, then, no question of confusion.</p>

<p>Mr. Cotter Morison says it is ‘not far short of impossible’
that Bernard showed any active hostility to Abélard at that time,
and he thinks the charge springs merely from an over-excited
imagination. Mr. Morison is scarcely happier<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> here than in his earlier passage. It
must be understood that this reluctance to admit the correctness of
Abélard’s complaint is inspired by a passage in one of Bernard’s
letters. In writing to William of St. Thierry (ep. cccxxvii. in
<i>Migne</i>), fifteen years afterwards, he excuses his inaction with
regard to Abélard (whose heresies William has put before him) on the
ground that he ‘was ignorant of most, indeed nearly all, of these
things.’ This is interpreted to mean that he knew little or nothing
about Abélard until 1141, and the Abélardists generally give a more
or less polite intimation that it is—what Mr. Poole explicitly calls
another statement of Bernard’s—a lie. Cotter Morison, however,
interprets ‘these things’ to mean ‘the special details of Abélard’s
heresy,’ and it is therefore the more strange that he should join
the Bernardists in straining the historical evidence. Yet he is
probably nearer to the truth than the others in his interpretation of
Bernard’s words. Even modern writers are too apt at times to follow
the practice of the Church, in judging a statement or an action, and
put it into one or other of their rigid objective categories. In such
cases as this we need a very careful psychological analysis, and
are prone to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span>
misled by the Church’s objective moral boxes or classifications. Most
probably Bernard wrote in that convenient vagueness of mind which
sometimes helps even a saint out of a difficulty, especially where
the honour of the Church is involved, and which is accompanied by
just a suspicion of ethical discomfort.</p>

<p>In reality, we may, with all sobriety, reverse Mr. Morison’s
statement, and say it is ‘not far short of impossible’ that Bernard
was ignorant of, or indifferent to, Abélard’s activity at that time.
Ten years previously, when Bernard led his little band of white-robed
monks to their wretched barn in the Vale of Bitterness, he went to
Châlons to be consecrated by William of Champeaux. William conceived
a very strong affection for the young abbot, and he shortly after
nursed him through a long and severe illness. So great was their
intimacy and so frequent their intercourse that people said Châlons
and Clairvaux had changed places. This began only twelve months
after William had been driven from Paris, in intense anger, by the
heretical upstart, Peter Abélard. Again, Alberic was another of
Bernard’s intimate friends. A year or two before Abélard founded the
Paraclete—that is to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p.
196]</span> about the time of the Council of Soissons—we find Bernard
‘imploring’ (so even Duchesne puts it) the Pope to appoint Alberic
to the vacant see of Châlons after the death of William. He failed
to obtain it, but afterwards secured for him the archbishopric of
Bourges. Anselm of Laon was also a friend of Bernard’s. Moreover,
Clairvaux was only about forty miles from Troyes, where Abélard’s
latest feat was the supreme topic.</p>

<p>It is thus quite impossible for any but a prejudiced apologist
to question Bernard’s interest in the life of the Paraclete and its
founder. Even were he not the heresy-hunter and universal reformer
that he notoriously was, we should be compelled to think that he
had heard all the worst charges against Abélard over and over
again before 1124. To conceive Bernard as entombed in his abbey,
indifferent to everything in this world except the grave, is the
reverse of the truth. Bernard had a very profound belief in what
some theologians call ‘the law of secondary causes’—God does not do
directly what he may accomplish by means of human instruments. Prayer
was necessary; but so were vigilance, diplomacy, much running to and
fro, and a vast correspondence. He watched the Church of God<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span> with the fiery zeal
of a St. Paul. He knew everything and everybody: smote archbishops
and kings as freely as his own monks: hunted down every heretic
that appeared in France in his day: played even a large part in the
politics of Rome. And we are to suppose that such a man was ignorant
of the presence of the gay, rationalistic colony a few leagues away
from his abbey, and of the unique character and profound importance
to the Church of that vast concourse of youths; or that he refrained
from examining the teaching of this man who had an unprecedented
influence over the youth of France, or from using the fulness of his
power against him when he found that his teaching was the reverse of
all he held sacred and salutary.</p>

<p>We may take Abélard’s statement literally. Bernard and Norbert
were doing the work of his rivals, and were doing it effectively.
They who had supported him at Soissons or afterwards were being
poisoned against him. Count Theobald and Geoffrey of Chartres are
probably two whom he had in mind. He feels that the net is being
drawn close about him through the calumnies of these ubiquitous monks
and canons. The peace of the valley is broken; he becomes<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span> morbidly sensitive
and timorous. Whenever he hears that some synod or conventicle has
been summoned he trembles with anxiety and expectation of another
Soissons. The awful torture of that hour before the council comes
back to him, and mingles with the thought of the power of his new
enemies. He must fly from France.</p>

<p>Away to the south, over the Pyrenees, was a land where the poor
monk would have found peace, justice, and honour. Spain was just then
affording ‘glory to God in heaven, and peace to men of good-will on
earth’: it had been snatched from the dominion of Christianity for a
century or two. So tolerant and beneficent was the reign of the Moors
that even the Jews, crushed, as they were, by seven centuries of
persecution, developed their finest powers under it. They were found
in the front rank of every art and science; in every field where, not
cunning and astuteness, but talent of the highest order and industry,
were needed to command success. The Moors had happily degenerated
from the fierce proselytism of their religious prophet—whilst the
Christians had proportionately enlarged on that of theirs—and their
human character was asserting the high natural ideal which it always
does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span> when it
breaks away from the confining bonds of a narrow dogma.</p>

<p>It was towards this land that Abélard turned his thoughts. It
seemed useless for him to exchange one Christian land for another.
A few years before, a small group of French monks had created a
centre of education in a humble barn on the banks of the Cam; but
was England more tolerant than France? He remembered Roscelin’s
experience. There were famous schools in Italy; but some of his most
brilliant pupils at the Paraclete, such as Arnold of Brescia, had
little good to say of Italy. The evil lay in Christianity itself—in
that intolerance which its high claim naturally engendered.</p>

<p>One does not like to accept too easily this romantic proposal
to find refuge under the protection of the crescent, yet Abélard’s
words compel us to do so. ‘God knows,’ he says, ‘that at times I fell
into so deep a despair that I proposed to go forth from Christendom
and betake me to the heathens ... to live a Christian life amid the
enemies of Christ.’ Possibly he would have done so, if he had had a
better knowledge of Spain at that time. The Arabs of Spain were no
enemies of Christ. Only a most perverse idea<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span> of their state could make an able
thinker and teacher thus regard a life amongst them as a matter
of ultimate and desperate resort. Had they but conquered Europe,
materially or morally, half the problems that still harass it—or
ought to do—would have been solved long ago. It is pathetic to find
Abélard speculating whether the hatred of the Christians for him will
not make his path easier to the favour of the Arabs, by producing in
them an impression that he had been unfaithful to Christian dogma.
The caliphs could keep a watchful eye on the thoughts of professed
Mohammedan philosophers, but they cared little about the theories
of others. Abélard, with his pronounced tendency to concentrate on
natural-religious and ethical truths, would have found an honoured
place in Spain; and he would quickly have buried his dogmas there.</p>

<p>Abélard was spared the trial of so desperate and dreadful a
secession. Far away on the coast of Brittany an abbot died in 1125,
and Abélard’s evil genius put it into the hearts of the monks to
offer the vacant dignity to the famous teacher. They sent some of
their number to see him at the Paraclete. It seemed a providential
outlet from his intolerable position. There were abbeys<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> and abbeys, it was
true, but his Breton optimism and trust in fate closed that avenue of
speculation. Conon, Duke of Brittany, had agreed to his installation.
Suger made no opposition; he probably saw the net that was being
drawn about him in France. Abélard turned sadly away from the vale of
the Paraclete and the devoted colony, and faced the mists of the west
and of the future. ‘I came not to bring peace into the world but the
sword.’</p>

</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Abélard</span> had, of course,
committed another serious blunder in accepting the proffered
‘dignity.’ There was an error on both sides, as there had been in
his first fatal assumption of the cowl; though on this occasion the
pressure behind him was greater, the alternative less clear, and
the prospect at least uncertain. It will be remembered that Abélard
probably studied at Locmenach in his early years. This was a branch
monastery of the ancient abbey of St. Gildas at Rhuys, on the coast;
and it is not impossible that some recollection of the monks of
Locmenach entered into his decision to become abbot of St. Gildas.
There were probably few abbeys in France at the time which were
sufficiently moral and earnest in their life to offer a congenial
home to this man who is held up to the blushes of the ages as a
sinner, and of whom the Church only speaks in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span> the low and solemn tone that befits a
great scandal. If Abélard’s first and chief misfortune is that he was
a Christian, his second is that he was a monk.</p>

<p>The abbey of St. Gildas had reached the last stage of monastic
decay. The monks did not accept presents of pretty maid-servants,
nor receive fine lady visitors in their abbey, like the monks of St.
Denis; nor were they eager to have a nunnery of sisters in religion
close at hand, like the cloistered canons. Theirs was not a case for
the application of the words of Erasmus: ‘Vocantur “patres”—et saepe
sunt.’ Each monk had a respectable wife and family on the monastic
estate. The outlying farms and cottages were colonised with the women
and the little monklings; there was no cemetery of infant bones at
or near St. Gildas. Their monasticism consisted in the discharge of
their formal religious exercises in church and choir—the chant of the
Mass and of the breviary. And when the monk had done his day’s work
of seven or eight hours’ chanting, he would retire, like every other
Christian, to the bosom of his family. The half-civilised Celtic
population of the district were quite content with this version of
their duty, and did not refuse them the customary sustenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span></p>

<p>Abélard’s horror on discovering this state of things was equalled
by the surprise of the monks when they discovered his Quixotic ideas
of monastic life. They only knew Abélard as the amorous troubadour,
the teacher who attracted crowds of gay and wealthy scholars wherever
he went, the object of the bitter hostility of the monastic reformers
whom they detested. It was the Bernardist or Norbertian Abélard whom
they had chosen for their abbot. Surprise quickly turned to disgust
when the new abbot lectured them in chapter—as a sexless ascetic
could so well do—on the beauty of continence and the Rule of St.
Benedict. They were rough, ignorant, violent men, and they soon made
it clear that reform was hopelessly out of the question.</p>

<p>The very locality proved an affliction. He had exchanged the
gentle beauty and the mild climate of the valley of the Seine for a
wild, bleak, storm-swept sea-shore. The abbey was built on a small
promontory that ran out into the Bay of Biscay, a few leagues to the
south of Vannes. It was perched on the edge of the steep granite
cliffs, and Abélard’s very pen seems to shudder as he writes of the
constant roar of the waves at the foot of the rocks and the sweep of
the ocean winds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>
Behind them stretched a long series of sand-hills. They occupied a
scarcely gracious interval between desolation and desolation. For
Abélard was not of the temperament to appreciate the grandeur of an
ever-restless ocean or to assimilate the strength that is borne on
its winds. He was sadly troubled. Here he had fled, he says, to the
very end of the earth, the storm-tossed ocean barring his further
retreat, yet he finds the world no less repulsive and cruel.</p>

<p>In the character of abbot, Abélard was at liberty to seek what
consolation he could outside his abbey. He soon found that there
was none to be had in the vicinity of Rhuys. ‘The whole barbarous
population of the land was similarly lawless and undisciplined,’
he says; that seems to include such other monks and priests as the
locality contained. Even their language was unintelligible to him,
he complains; for, although he was a Breton, his ear would only
be accustomed to Latin and to Romance French, which would differ
considerably from the Celtic Bas-Breton. Whether the lord of the
district was equally wild—as seems most probable—or no, the way to
his château was barred by another difficulty. He was considered
the bitter enemy of the abbey, for he had ‘annexed’ the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span> lands that belonged by
right to the monks. Moreover he exacted a heavy tribute from them.
They were frequently without food, and wandered about stealing all
they could lay their hands on for the support of their wives and
families. They violently urged Abélard to fight for their rights and
find food for them, instead of giving them his ethereal discourses.
And the abbot succeeded just far enough to embitter the usurper
against him, without obtaining much for his lawless monks. He
found himself in a new dilemma. If he remained in the abbey he was
assailed all day by the hungry clamour and the brutal violence of his
‘subjects’; if he went abroad the tyrannical lord threatened to have
him done to death by his armed retainers.</p>

<p>For three or four years Abélard sustained this miserable
existence almost without alleviation. In 1129, however, an event
occurred which, evil as it looked at the moment, proved a source of
considerable happiness to him for some years.</p>

<p>Abbot Suger, the cowled warrior and statesman, had become
monastic reformer after his conversion. The circumstance proved more
lucrative to St. Denis than would be thought. In his <i>De rebus a se
gestis</i>, Suger writes at great length of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span> additional possessions he secured for
the abbey, and amongst these is enumerated the nunnery of St. Mary
at Argenteuil. He was not only a rigid disciplinarian, but he had an
unusual acquaintance with ancient records. Many of his early years at
St. Denis had been spent in the <i>archivium</i>, in diligent scrutiny of
deeds and documents relating to the earlier history of the abbey. One
day when he was absorbed in this study he hit upon a document from
which it seemed possible to prove that the convent of the Benedictine
nuns at Argenteuil, two or three miles away, belonged to the monks
of St. Denis. It was a complicated question, the nuns dating their
possession from the time of Charlemagne. But when Suger became abbot
of St. Denis himself, and eager to employ his political ability and
influence in the service of the abbey, he recollected, along with
others, the document relating to the nunnery. When, moreover, he had
been converted, he was able to see the licentiousness of the nuns of
Argenteuil, and make it a pretext for asserting the rights of his
abbey.</p>

<p>In 1127, he states in his Life, he obtained from Honorius
<small>II.</small> a bull which was supposed to legalise his
seizure of the convent: ‘both in justice to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span> ourselves and on account of the
enormity of life of the nuns who were established there, he restored
the place to us with its dependencies, so that the religious life
might be re-instituted in it.’ In his <i>Vita Ludovici Grossi</i> he also
lays stress on the ‘foul enormity’ of life in the nunnery.</p>

<p>How far we may accept the strong language of the enterprising
abbot it would be difficult to say. Honorius, who would be flattered
by the request to pronounce on the domestics difficulties of the
Church of France, would certainly not be over-exacting in the matter
of proof. Still, he sent a legate, the Bishop of Albano, and directed
him to hold an inquiry into the affair, together with the Archbishop
of Rheims and the Bishops of Paris, Chartres, and Soissons. The
name of Geoffrey of Chartres is a guarantee that the inquiry was
more than a mere cloak to cover the sanctioning of a questionable
act. Although, we must remember, Suger does not quote their words
in the above passage, they must have decided that his charge was
substantially founded. The nuns were turned out of their convent a
few months afterwards.</p>

<p>The asserted corruption of the nunnery is quite in accord
with what we know of the period from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span> other sources. We have already quoted
Jacques de Vitry’s observation that none of the convents of the time,
except those of the Cistercians (his own order), were fit places for
an honest woman; and he describes the ‘thousand tricks and wicked
artifices’ by which respectable dames were sometimes induced to enter
them. The same Vandyke-like painter of the morals of the twelfth
century elsewhere passes a comprehensive sentence on the convents of
canonesses. Nor was this the first Parisian nunnery to be suppressed
in the twelfth century. There was until 1107 a convent of Benedictine
nuns on the island, on the site of the present Rue Calende. It was
close to the royal palace; and the relations of the nuns to the
nobles of the court had become so notorious that Bishop Galo had
to intervene and put the good sisters on the street. One has only
to read Abélard’s sermon on ‘Susannah’ (delivered to an exemplary
community of nuns) to realise the condition of the average nunnery at
that time.</p>

<p>Heloise was prioress of the convent of Argenteuil. This is,
indeed, the only circumstance that need make us hesitate to accept
Suger’s words at their literal value. The Heloise of those writers
who have but touched the love-romance of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span> famous couple, without entering into a
deeper study of their characters, is pitifully inadequate. She had
all the passion that poetic or decadent admirer has ever given her;
she had that freer, because narrower, view of the love-relation,
which only regarded her own particular and exceptional case, and did
not extend to the thousand cases on which the broad law of matrimony
is based; and she retained her ardent love and her particularist
view throughout long years of conventual life. We may examine this
more directly in the next chapter. For the moment it reveals, when
it is taken in conjunction with that integrity and altitude of life
which none can hesitate to assign her, a strength and elevation of
character which are frequently obscured by the mere admirers of her
passion. We know nothing whatever of the eight or nine miserable
years of her life at Argenteuil; but as soon as she does emerge into
the light of history (in 1130) she is found to be of an elevated
and commanding character. She was prior, not abbess, at Argenteuil.
When she became abbess, her community became a centre of light in
France.</p>

<p>Still, Heloise shared the fate of her sisters, if she had
not shared their sin; in fact, we may<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span> see a protest against their life in her
refusal to follow them to a new home. Suger had been directed to find
a nunnery which would receive the evicted sisters, and most of them
had gone to St. Mary of Footel. Heloise had not accompanied them,
and she was still without a canonical home in 1129, when the news of
these events reached the distant abbey of St. Gildas.</p>

<p>The finest and supreme test of love is to purge it of the last
subtle admixture of sexual feeling and then measure its strength. As
a rule this is wholly impracticable—Mr. W. Platt has a remarkable
paper on the subject in his <i>Women, Love, and Life</i>—but in the
case of Abélard the test was applied in supreme rigour, and with a
satisfactory issue. There was indeed another consideration impelling
Abélard, when he sought out his nun-wife. The desertion of the
Paraclete had cost him many a heavy thought. The little estate was
still his legal property, but it was insufficient to support a
priest and companion at the oratory. He would assuage both anxieties
by installing Heloise and such companions as she chose in his old
home. But the course of the story will reveal more clearly the
deep affection he had for Heloise. It was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span> faithfulness to the views he held since
his conversion, faithfulness to the ideal of the best men of the
time, as well as a dread of the ever ready tongue of the calumniator,
that separated him so long and so sternly from her.</p>

<p>In 1129, therefore, the year in which the plague ravaged Paris,
Abélard revisited the quiet valley of the Arduzon. Thither he invited
Heloise and some of her companions, to whom he made over the legal
possession of the estate. Poor Heloise must have been disappointed.
The ardour which she reveals in her letters was evidently met by a
great restraint and formality on his side. He was severely correct
in the necessary intercourse with his ‘sisters in religion.’ Later
events showed that, ridiculous as it may well seem, he had good
reason for this deference to detractors. However, Heloise soon won
universal regard and affection in Champagne. ‘The bishops came to
love her as a daughter,’ says Abélard, ‘the abbots as a sister,
and the laity as a mother.’ They lived in deep poverty and some
anxiety at first, but nobles and prelates soon added generously to
the resources of the new foundation. Noble dames, too, brought rich
dowries with them in coming to ask for the veil<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span> in Heloise’s respected community. The
priory grew rapidly in importance and good repute.</p>

<p>In 1131 Abélard sought a further favour for the new foundation,
in having Heloise raised to the dignity of abbess. Innocent
<small>II.</small> was making a journey through France, and lavishing
favours (when they cost him nothing) generously and gratuitously
on all sides, behaving in a manner that departed widely from papal
traditions. It was the second year of the great papal schism, and,
Anacletus having bought or otherwise secured Rome, through his
family, the Pierleoni, Innocent was making a successful bid for
France, where exception was taken to Pierleone’s Jewish strain.
Passing from Chartres to Liége, on his way to meet Lothair of Saxony,
Innocent spent a day or two at the Benedictine abbey of Morigni.
Abélard joined the crowd of prelates who assembled there to do
homage to the pope, and he obtained the promise of a bull (which
was duly sent), conferring the dignity of abbess on Heloise, and
securing to her and her successors the full canonical rights of
their abbey. Abélard seems to have been received with distinction
by the papal court. The chronicle of Morigni mentions the presence
of the Abbot of St. Gildas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p.
214]</span> and adds: ‘the most distinguished teacher and master
in the schools, to whom lovers of learning flocked from almost the
whole of Christendom.’ Later, too, Abélard boasts (so says Bernard)
of his friends amongst the Roman cardinals; it must have been during
the stay of the papal court at Morigni that he met them. Another
noteworthy personage whom Abélard met there was St. Bernard. We have
no details about this first meeting of the two great antagonists, but
their names occur side by side in the chronicle as those of the most
eminent teacher and the most distinguished preacher in France.</p>

<p>In the increasing bitterness of life at St. Gildas Abélard now
naturally sought consolation in the new abbey of the Paraclete. His
relation to Heloise personally remained marked by a reserve which
hurt her, but his visits to the abbey became more frequent and
prolonged. It appears that this loosened the tongues of some foolish
people, and Abélard took up the accusation, or insinuation, with
his usual gravity. His apology is often described as ‘ridiculous’
and ‘painful’; and one certainly cannot take very seriously his
dissertation on Origen’s misdeed and the Oriental custom of
eunuch-guardians. More interesting is the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span> second part, in which he urges many
precedents of the familiarity of saintly men with women. His
favourite saint, Jerome, afforded a conspicuous illustration; and
others were not wanting. It is too early in the history of theology
to find the example of Christ adduced. A modern apologist could
greatly extend the list, beginning with Francis of Assisi (and
Clare) and ending with Francis de Sales (and Madame de Chantal).
Perhaps Abélard’s own case is the clearest proof that even masked
sexual feeling may be entirely absent from such attachments. Those
who care to analyse them will probably find the greater refinement,
gentleness, sympathy, and admiration of women to be quite adequate to
explain such saintly intimacies, without any subtle research into the
psychology of sex. However, the complaint seems to have moderated the
abbot’s fervour for a time; and indeed events soon became absorbingly
interesting at St. Gildas.</p>

<p>The frequent journeys to Champagne increased the bitterness of his
monks. Then he had a serious accident, nearly breaking his neck in a
fall from his horse. When he recovered, he found that his monks had
entered upon a most dangerous stage of conspiracy. The accident<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span> seems to have suggested
an idea to them, and they determined to rid themselves of an abbot
who was worse than useless. They even put poison in the wine which
he was to use in the Mass one morning, but he discovered the fact
in time. On another occasion he had an adventure which may have
suggested an important incident in M. Zola’s <i>Rome</i>. He had gone to
Nantes to visit the count in an illness, and was staying with his
brother Dagobert, who was a canon in the cathedral. When the time
came for the abbot and his monastic companion to sup, Abélard had,
providentially, lost his appetite—or suspected something. The monk
supped—and died. As Abélard’s servant disappeared after the meal,
it was natural to suppose that he had been paid by the ferocious
monks to poison their abbot. ‘How many times did they try to do away
with me by poison!’ he exclaimed. But he lived apart from them, and
succeeded in frustrating the attempt. Then they hired robbers to
apply their professional skill to the task. Whenever the monks heard
that he was going anywhere, they planted a few cut-throats on the
route.</p>

<p>Abélard had no great love for this Dionysiac existence,
and he resolved to make a bold effort<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span> at reform. He summoned the monks in
solemn chapter, and hurled the sentence of excommunication at the
leaders of the revolt. It sat more lightly on their shoulders than
the abbot anticipated, and he proceeded to call in the help of a
papal legate. The Duke of Brittany and several neighbouring bishops
were invited to the function, and the sentence of excommunication
and expulsion from the abbey was repeated with impressive ceremony.
The chief rebels were thus restricted to following the abbot’s
movements without—in company, apparently, of the hired assassins
of the monks and the equally dangerous servants of the lord of the
manor—and Abélard devoted his attention to reforming the remainder of
the community. But the old abbey was past redemption. ‘The remaining
monks began to talk, not of poison, but of cutting my throat,’ he
says. The circle of knives was drawing closer upon him, within and
without, and he saw that it would be impossible to guard his life
much longer. He gave up the struggle, and fled from the abbey.
There is a local tradition which tells of a secret flight by night
through a subterranean passage leading down to the sea. Abélard
at least intimates there was little dignity in his retire<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span>ment, when he says:
‘under the guidance of a certain noble of the district I succeeded,
with great difficulty, in escaping from the abbey.’</p>

<p>Where Abélard found refuge from his murderous ‘sons,’ and where
he spent the next three or four years, it is difficult to say. He
probably moved from place to place, generally remaining in the
neighbourhood of Rhuys, but occasionally journeying to Champagne
or accepting an invitation to preach at some special festival. The
‘certain noble’—an uncertain one, as the phrase usually implies—would
be likely to give him immediate hospitality; and the Count of Nantes
was friendly, and would find Abélard a graceful addition at his
board. Then there was the family château at Pallet, and the house
of his brother Dagobert at Nantes. We seem to find Abélard’s boy,
Astrolabe, under the care of this brother later on. Abélard would at
all events see much of him, and assist in educating him, either at
Pallet or Nantes. The son had, apparently, not inherited the gifts of
his parents. An obscure mention of his death in a later <i>necrologium</i>
merely indicates the close of a correct but ordinary ecclesiastical
career.</p>

<p>But though Abélard lacked neither wealth, nor<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> honour, nor home, he
speaks of his condition as a very pitiable one. Deutsch has hazarded
the conjecture that the monks of St. Gildas really desired an abbot
who would be generally absent. It seems rather that they wanted
an abbot who would share their comfortable theory of life and at
the same time have influence to enrich the abbey, discontinue the
paying of tribute, and induce a higher authority to restrain their
tyrannical neighbours. They were therefore naturally inflamed when
Abélard deserted the immediate concerns of the abbey, yet remained
near enough to secure his revenue out of its income. He retained his
title (we find no successor appointed until after his death), and as
he speaks of wealth, we must suppose that he somehow continued to
obtain his income. The Count of Nantes would probably support his
cause as long as he remained in Brittany. But, at the same time,
this detained him in the constant danger of assassination. Wherever
he went, he apprehended bribery and corruption, poison and poniards.
‘My misery grew with my wealth,’ he says, and ‘I find no place where
I may rest or live.’ His classical reading promptly suggests the
parallel of Damocles.</p>

<p>It was in these circumstances that Abélard wrote<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span> the famous letter which
he entitled the ‘Story of my Calamities.’ The passage I have just
quoted occurs in its closing paragraph. It is an invaluable document
for the purpose of the great master’s biography. Without it, the life
of Abélard would occupy only a score of pages. His contemporaries
had numbers of monastic followers and admirers who were eager to
write their deeds in letters of gold. The little band of friends who
stood around Abélard in his final struggle were scattered, cowed,
or murdered, by triumphant Bernardism. At the mention of Bernard’s
name Christendom crossed itself and raised its eyes to the clouds:
at the mention of the ‘Peripatetic of Pallet’ it closed its pious
lips, forgetful, or ignorant, of the twenty years of profound sorrow
for the one grave delinquency of his life. If the sins of youth are
to leave an indelible stain, one is forced to recall that Augustine
had been a greater sinner, and that the Canon of the Church contains
the names of converted prostitutes, such as Mary of Magdala and
Mary Magdalene of Pazzi. It may be thought by some Catholics that,
in the uncertainty of human judgment, there is a providential
criterion given in the working of miracles; but, once more, even the
fifth century only credited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p.
221]</span> St. Augustine with two miracles. And if intention to
serve the Church be all-important, Abélard has won high merit; or
if effective service to the Church, then is his merit the greater,
for the thirteenth century, in its construction of that theology
and philosophy which the Church even now deems sufficient for the
needs of the world, utterly rejected Bernardism, and borrowed its
foundation from Pierre Abélard.</p>

<p>As a piece of literature the ‘Story’ lies under the disadvantage
of being written in degenerate Latin. With all his classical reading,
Abélard has not escaped the use of forms which gravely offend the
classical taste. Perhaps John of Salisbury is superior to him in
this respect; there have certainly been later theologians, such
as Petavius, who have far surpassed him. But, apart from this
limitation in form, it is as high above the many biographies and
autobiographies of his contemporaries as he himself was above most
of their writers. Abbot Suger’s autobiography is a piece of vulgar
and crude self-advertisement beside it. It has not the mere chance
immortality which honours such works as that of Suger, and which is
wholly due to the zeal of the modern collector of ancient documents;
it has the germ of immor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p.
222]</span>tality within it—the same soul that lives in the
<i>Confessions</i> of Augustine: those who understand that soul will not
add the <i>Confession</i> of Rousseau. And the confession of Abélard has
this singular feature: it is written by a man to whom the former
sinful self is dead in a way which was impossible to Augustine. That
feature implies both advantages and disadvantages, but it at least
gives a unique value and interest to the document.</p>

<p>We have throughout relied on and quoted this autobiography, so
that an analysis of its contents would be superfluous. There remains,
however, the interesting question of Abélard’s motive for writing
it. It is ostensibly written as a letter, addressed to a friend who
is in trouble, and merely intended to give him some consolation by a
comparison of the sorrows of Abélard. No one will seriously question
that this is only a rhetorical artifice. Probably it reached such
a friend, but it was obviously written for ‘publication.’ In its
sincere acknowledgment of whatever fault lay on his conscience,
only striving to excuse where the intention was clearly good, that
is, in the matter of his theological opinions, the letter must be
regarded as a conciliatory document. Not only<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span> its elaborate construction, but its
care in explaining how guiltless he was in the making of most of
his enemies—Anselm, Alberic, Norbert, Bernard, and the monks of St.
Denis and St. Gildas—impel us to think that it was intended for
circulation in France. In a few years we shall find him in Paris once
more. Deutsch believes that the ‘Story’ was written and circulated to
prepare the way for his return, and this seems very probable. From
‘the ends of the earth’ his thoughts and hopes were being redirected
towards Paris; it had availed him nothing to fly from it. But there
were calumnious versions abroad of every step in his eventful life,
and even Bernard sneered at his experience at St. Gildas. He would
make an effort to regain the affection of some of his old friends, or
to create new admirers.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the aim of Abélard in writing his ‘Story,’
it had one immediate consequence of the first literary importance.
Great of itself, it evoked a correspondence which is unique in the
literature of the world. It fell into the hands of Abbess Heloise,
and led to the writing of her famous <i>Letters</i>.</p>

  <h2 title="CHAPTER XI - THE LETTERS OF ABÉLARD AND HELOISE">CHAPTER XI</h2>
  <p class="subh2">THE LETTERS OF ABÉLARD AND HELOISE</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> true interest of the
correspondence between the abbot husband and the abbess wife, which
resulted from the publication of the ‘Story of my Calamities,’
needs to be pointed out afresh at the beginning of the twentieth
century. It has been obscured through the eagerness of historians
to indicate parallels and the tendency of poets and romancers to
isolate features which appeal to them. During the eighteenth century
the famous letters were made familiar to English readers by a number
of translations from the French or from the original Latin. Even
then there was a tendency to read them apart from the lives of
the writers, or at least without an adequate preliminary study of
their characters and their fortunes. Those translations are read
no longer. Apart from the limited number of readers who have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span> appreciated the
excellent French versions of Madame Guizot and M. Gréard, an idea is
formed of the letters and their writers from a few ardent fragments,
which are misleading in their isolation, and from the transference
of the names ‘Abélard’ and ‘Heloise’ to more recent characters of
history or romance. The letters must be read anew in the light of our
augmented knowledge and of the juster psychological analysis which it
has made possible.</p>

<p>There are those whose sole knowledge of Heloise is derived from
the reading of Pope’s well-known poem, which is taken to be a
metrical exposition of her first letter. With such an impression,
and a few broad outlines of the life of the lovers, one is well
prepared to accept the assertion of a parallel with the <i>Portuguese
Letters</i> and other of the <i>lettres amoureuses</i> which were so dear
to the eighteenth century. Probably few who compare Pope with the
original, or indeed read him without comparison, will agree with
Hallam that he has put ‘the sentiments of a coarse and abandoned
woman into her mouth.’ Johnson found ‘no crudeness of sense, no
asperity of language’ in Pope’s poem. Yet no one who has carefully
read the original will fail to perceive<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span> that Pope has given a greatly distorted
version of it. French versifiers found it ‘un amusement littéraire et
galant,’ as has been said of Bussy-Rabutin’s version, to isolate the
element of passion in the finer soul of Heloise, and thus present her
as a twelfth-century Marianne Alcoforado. Pope has yielded somewhat
to the same spirit. He does indeed introduce the intellectual
judgment and the complex ethical feeling of Heloise in his poem, but
he alters the proportions of the psychic elements in her letter, and
prepares the way for a false estimate. Pope’s <i>Heloise</i> is framed
in the eighteenth century as naturally as the real <i>Heloise</i> is in
the twelfth. Still, it must be remembered that Pope did not write
from the original Latin letters. He evidently used some of the
so-called ‘translations,’ but really paraphrases, of his time.<a
id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The charge must also be laid, though with less insistence,
against the parallels which some writers<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span> have discovered, or invented, for
Heloise. The most famous are the <i>Portuguese Letters</i>, a series of
singularly ardent love-letters from a Portuguese nun to a French
noble. The correspondents are said to have been Marianne Alcoforado
and M. de Chamilly—to look at whom, said St. Simon, you would never
have thought him the soul of the <i>Portuguese Letters</i>. He was
neither talented nor handsome, and his liaison with the nun seems to
have been no more than the usual temporary incident in a soldier’s
life. When he returned to France she wrote the letters which are so
frequently associated with those of Heloise. It is an unworthy and
a superficial comparison. There is a ground for comparison in the
condition of the writer and in the free and vivid expression of a
consuming love, but they are separated by profound differences. The
Portuguese nun has nothing but her love; her life is being consumed
in one flame of passion. Heloise is never so wholly lost in her
passion; she can regard it objectively. Even were Abélard other
than he was at the time, no one who knows Heloise could conceive
her, after her vows, to say, ‘if it were possible for me to get
out of this miserable cloister, I should not wait in Portugal for
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span> fulfilment
of your promise,’ or imagine her, under any conditions, to talk
lightheartedly to her lover of ‘the languid pleasures your French
mistresses give you,’ and remind him that he only sought in her ‘un
plaisir grossier.’ There is not a word, in any of the <i>Portuguese
Letters</i>, of God, of religious vows, of any thought or feeling above
the plane of sense, of any appreciation of the literal sacrilege
of her position, of anything but a wilful abandonment to a violent
passion.</p>

<p>There are the same defects, though they are less obtrusive, in the
parallel which Rousseau claimed in giving the title of the <i>Nouvelle
Heloïse</i> to his Savoyard letters. The accidental resemblance of the
religious costume is wanting here, but, on the other hand, there is
a greater show of character. Rousseau has confused the Heloise of
1117 and the abbess of the letters. From another point of view, one
would like to know what Bussy-Rabutin or Colardeau would have thought
of the <i>Nouvelle Heloïse</i> as the expression of an absorbing passion.
Rousseau, who held that the <i>Portuguese Letters</i> had been written by
a man, was of the singular opinion that no woman could describe, or
even feel, love. The letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p.
229]</span> of his Julie are pale fires beside the first and
second letters of Heloise.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In direct opposition to the writers who find parallels for the
correspondence of abbess and abbot we have a few critics who deny or
doubt the authenticity of the letters. It is significant that the
recent and critical German biographers of Abélard do not even mention
these doubts. They have, in truth, the slenderest of foundations.
Lalanne, who has endeavoured to spread this heresy in faithful
France, can say little more than that he cannot reconcile the tone
of the letters with the age and condition of the writers; he also
says that Abélard would be hardly likely to preserve such letters
had he received them from his wife. Orelli has tried to sow similar
doubts in the apparently more promising soil of German culture, but
with no greater success. If it seems incredible that Heloise should
have penned the letters which bear her name, how shall we qualify the
supposition that there lived, some time within<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span> the following century, a genius capable
of creating them, yet utterly unknown to his contemporaries? If
they are the work of some admirer of Abélard, as Orelli thinks,
they reveal a higher literary competency than Rousseau shows in his
<i>Nouvelle Heloïse</i>. We are asked to reject a wonder in the name of
a greater wonder. Moreover, an admirer of Abélard would not have
written the letters which bear his name in a style that has won
for him anything but the admiration of posterity. And it is quite
impossible to admit one series of the letters without the other.</p>

<p>Setting apart the letters of Abélard, which it is idle to question
in themselves, it must be admitted that there are features in the
letters of Heloise which are startling to the modern mind. These
are the features on which her romantic admirers have concentrated;
they will appear in due course. But when one evades the pressure
of modern associations, and considers the correspondence in its
twelfth-century setting, there is no inherent improbability in
it. Rather the reverse. As to the publication of letters in which
husband and wife had written the most sacred confidences, we need
not suppose, as M. Gréard does, that Heloise ever intended such a
result,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span> or built
up her notes into letters for that purpose. Nothing compels us to
think that they were brought together until years after the writers
had been laid in a common tomb. There are obvious interpolations,
it is true, but we shall only increase the difficulty—nay, we shall
create a difficulty—if we look upon the most extraordinary passages
in the letters as coming from any other source than the heart of an
impassioned lover.</p>

<p>As regards what a logician would call the external difficulty—that
we cannot trace the letters further back than the middle of the
thirteenth century—it need not discompose us. The conditions which
make a negative argument of that character valid are not present
here. Abélard had been condemned and his party scattered. There are
no writers to whom we should look for allusions to the letters before
Guillaume de Lorris and Jehan le Meung manifestly introduce them in
the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>. Indeed this circumstance, and the fact that
the oldest manuscript we have dates from one hundred years after the
death of Heloise, incline one to think that she wished the treasure
to be preserved in a reverent privacy.</p>

<p>To give any large proportion of the letters<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span> here would be impossible, yet we
must give such extracts from them as may serve in the task of
reconstructing character. It was an age when the practice, if not
the art, of letter-writing greatly flourished. St. Bernard’s letters
form a portly and a remarkable volume. The chroniclers of the time
have preserved an immense number of the Latin epistles which busy
couriers bore over the land. One is prepared, therefore, to find
much formality, much attention to the rules and the conventional
graces of the epistolary art, even in the letters of Heloise. The
strong, impetuous spirit does at times break forth, in splendid
violence, from its self-imposed restraint, but we have, on the whole,
something very unlike the utter and unthinking outpouring of an
ebullient passion which is found in the letters of the Portuguese
nun. Arguments are rounded with quotations from classic writers;
dialectical forms are introduced here and there; a care for literary
manner and construction of the Latin periods is manifested. Bayle
says her Latin is ‘too frequently pedantic and subtile.’ It is,
at all events, much superior to the average Latinity of the time,
though, as in the case of Abélard, the characteristic defects of this
are not entirely avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span></p>

<p>Some day, then, after his ‘Story’ had gone forth on its peaceful
mission into France, Abélard received a folded parchment in the once
familiar hand.</p>

<p>‘To her lord, yea father: to her spouse, yea brother: from
his servant, yea daughter—his wife, his sister: to Abélard from
Heloise.’</p>

<p>So ran the superscription, a curious effort to breathe life into
a formality of the day. Chance has brought to their abbey, she says,
a copy of the letter he has recently sent forth. The story of his
saddened life and of the dangers that yet multiply about him has
affected them so deeply that they are filled with anxiety for him.
‘In hourly anguish do our trembling hearts and heaving breasts await
the dread rumour of thy death. By Him who still extends to thee an
uncertain protection we implore thee to inform us, His servants and
thine, by frequent letter, of the course of the storms in which
thou art still tossed; so that thou mayst let us at least, who have
remained true to thee, share thy sorrow or thy joy. And if the
storm shall have abated somewhat, so much the more speedily do thou
send us an epistle which will bring so much joy to us.’ She invokes
the authority of Seneca on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p.
234]</span> the epistolary duties of friends, and she has a holier
claim than that of friend, a stronger one than that of wife. ‘At thy
command I would change, not merely my costume, but my very soul,
so entirely art thou the sole possessor of my body and my spirit.
Never, God is my witness, never have I sought anything in thee but
thyself: I have sought thee, not thy gifts. I have not looked to the
marriage bond or dowry: I have not even yearned to satisfy my own
will and pleasure, but thine, as thou well knowest. The name of wife
may be the holier and more approved, but the name of friend—nay,
mistress or concubine, if thou wilt suffer it—has always been the
sweeter to me. For in thus humbling myself for thee, I should win
greater favour from thee, and do less injury to thy greatness. This
thou hast thyself not wholly forgotten, in the aforesaid letter thou
hast written for the consolation of a friend. Therein also thou hast
related some of the arguments with which I essayed to turn thee from
the thought of our unhappy wedlock, though thou hast omitted many in
which I set forth the advantage of love over matrimony, freedom over
bondage. God is my witness that if Augustus, the emperor of the whole
world, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span> to
honour me with the thought of wedlock, and yield me the empire of the
universe, I should deem it more precious and more honourable to be
thy mistress than to be the queen of a Cæsar.’</p>

<p>She claims no merit for her devotion. Abélard’s greatness more
than justifies her seeming extravagance. ‘Who,’ she asks, going
back to his golden age, ‘who did not hasten forth to look as thou
didst walk abroad, or did not follow thee with outstretched neck and
staring eyes? What wife, what maid, did not yearn for thee? What
queen or noble dame was there who did not envy my fortune?’</p>

<p>Yet she would ask this measure of gratitude from him, that he
write to her at times. He had never known refusal from her. ‘It was
not religious fervour that drew me to the rigour of the conventual
life, but thy command. How fruitlessly have I obeyed, if this gives
me no title to thy gratitude!... When thou didst hasten to dedicate
thyself to God I followed thee—nay, I went before thee. For, as if
mindful of the looking back of Lot’s wife, thou didst devote me to
God before thyself, by the sacred habit and vows of the monastery.
Indeed it was in this sole circumstance that I had the sorrow and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span> shame of
noting thy lack of confidence in me. God knows that I should not
have hesitated a moment to go before or to follow thee to the very
gates of hell, hadst thou commanded it. My soul was not my own but
thine.’</p>

<p>Let him, therefore, make this small return of a letter to relieve
her anxiety. ‘In earlier days, when thou didst seek worldly pleasure
with me, thy letters were frequent enough; thy songs put the name of
Heloise on every lip. Every street, every house in the city, echoed
with my name. How juster would it be to lead me now to God than thou
then didst to pleasure! Think then, I beseech thee, how much thou
owest me. With this brief conclusion I terminate my long letter.
Farewell, beloved.’</p>

<p>It is small wonder that the epistle placed Abélard in some
perplexity. True, the devoted Heloise had spoken throughout in the
past tense. But the ardour and the violence of her phrases betrayed
a present depth of emotion which he must regard with some dismay.
He had trusted that time and discipline would subdue the flame he
had enkindled, and here it was indirectly revealed to live still in
wondrous strength. He could not refuse to write, nor indeed would
such a neglect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>
profit anything; but he would send her a long letter of spiritual
direction, and endeavour to divert her meditations.</p>

<p>‘To Heloise, his sister in Christ, from Abélard, her brother in
Him,’ was the characteristic opening of his reply. If he has not
written to her since her conversion, he says, it is not from neglect
nor want of affection, but from the thought that she needed neither
counsel nor consolation. She had been prioress at Argenteuil, the
consoler and instructor of others. Yet, ‘if it seems otherwise to thy
humility,’ he will certainly write her on any point she may suggest.
She has spoken of prayer, and so he diverges into a long dissertation
on the excellence of prayer, which fills nearly the whole of his
pages. On one or two occasions only does he approach that colloquy of
soul to soul, for which Heloise yearned so ardently. ‘We ourselves
are united not only by the sanctity of our oath, but also by the
identity of our religious profession. I will pass over your holy
community, in which the prayers of so many virgins and widows ever
mount up to God, and speak of thee thyself, whose holiness hath
much favour with God, I doubt not, and remind thee what thou owest
me, particularly in this grievous peril of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span> mine. Do thou remember, then, in thy
prayers him who is so specially thine own.’ And when at length he
nears the end of his edifying treatise, he once more bares the heart
that still beats within him. If, he says, they hear before long that
he has fallen a victim to the plots of his enemies, or has by some
other chance laid down his burden of sorrow, he trusts they will have
his body brought to rest in their home, his own dear Paraclete, ‘for
there is no safer and more blessed spot for the rest of a sorrowing
soul.’</p>

<p>The long letter is, on the whole, prudent and formal to a degree.
Yet it is not true that Abélard had nothing but coldness and prudence
to return to his wife’s devotion. It is quite obvious what Abélard
would conceive to be his duty in replying to Heloise. For her sake
and for his, for her happiness and his repute, he must moderate the
threatening fire. But that he had a true affection and sympathy for
her is made clear by the occasional failure of his pious resolution.
‘Sister, who wert once dear to me in the world and art now most dear
in Christ,’ he once exclaims parenthetically; and at other moments he
calls her ‘dearest sister,’ and even ‘beloved.’ When we remember the
gulf that now separated them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p.
239]</span> besides his obvious duty to guide her, we shall accept
the contrast of their letters without using harsh words of the
distracted abbot. But the pathos and the humanity of his closing
paragraph defeated his purpose, and the whole soul of the abbess
flames forth in her reply.</p>

<p>It opens with a calm and somewhat artificial quarrel with the
superscription of his letter, but soon breaks out into strong
reproach for his talk of death. ‘How hast thou been able to frame
such thoughts, dearest?’ she asks; ‘how hast thou found words to
convey them?’ ‘Spare me, beloved,’ she says again: ‘talk not of death
until the dread angel comes near.’ Moreover, she and her nuns would
be too distracted with grief to pray over his corpse. Seneca and
Lucan are quoted to support her. Indeed she soon lapses into words
which the theologian would call blasphemous. She turns her face to
the heavens with that old, old cry, Where is Thy boasted justice?
They were untouched in the days of their sinful joy, but smitten with
a thousand sorrows as soon as their bed had the sacramental blessing.
‘Oh, if I dared but call God cruel to me! Oh, most wretched of all
creatures that I am!’ Women have ever been the ruin of men<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span>—Adam, Solomon,
Samson, Job—she runs through the long category of man’s sneaking
accusations.</p>

<p>She wishes she could make satisfaction to God for her sin, but,
‘if I must confess the true infirmity of my wretched soul, how can
I appease Him, when I am always accusing Him of the deepest cruelty
for this affliction?’ There is yet a further depth that she must
lay bare to her father confessor and her spouse. How can there be
question of penance ‘when the mind still retains the thought of
sinning, and is inflamed again with the old longing? So sweet did I
find the pleasures of our loving days, that I cannot bring myself to
reject them, nor banish them from my memory. Wheresoever I go they
thrust themselves upon my vision, and enkindle the old desire. Even
when I sleep they torment me with their fancied joy. Even during the
Mass, when our prayer should be purest, the dreadful vision of those
pleasures so haunts my soul that I am rather taken up with them than
with prayer. I ought to be lamenting what I have done; I am rather
lamenting what I miss. Not only our actions, but the places and the
times are so bound up with the thought of thee in my mind, that
night and day I am repeating all with thee in spirit. The move<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span>ment of body reveals my
thoughts at times; they are betrayed in unguarded speech. Oh, woe is
me!... Not knowing my hypocrisy, people call me “chaste.” They deem
bodily integrity a virtue, whereas virtue resides in the mind, not
the body.’ Moreover, virtue should be practised out of love for God,
whereas ‘God knows that in every part of my life I have more dread of
offending thee than Him; I have a greater desire to please thee than
Him.’ Let him not deceive himself with trust in <i>her</i> prayers, but
rather help her to overcome herself. And the poor woman, the nobility
of her soul hidden from her and crushed under the appalling ethical
ignorance and perverse ordering of her times, ends with a plaintive
hope that she may yet, in spite of all, find some corner in heaven
that will save her from the abyss.</p>

<p>We have here the passages which have made Heloise an heroine
in erotic circles for so many centuries. On these words, isolated
from their context of religious horror and self-accusation,
have Bussy-Rabutin, and Pope, and the rest, erected their gaudy
structures; on them is grounded the parallel with Marianne
Alcoforado, and Rousseau’s Julie, and so many other women<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span> who have meditated sin.
Bayle has carried his Pyrrhonism so far as to doubt that ‘bodily
integrity’ which she claims for herself with so little boasting;
Chateaubriand, with broader and truer judgment, finds in the letter
the mirroring of the soul of a good woman.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the optimism of Chateaubriand has
for once come nearer to the truth than the cynicism of Bayle. The
decadent admirers of Heloise forget three circumstances which should
have diminished their equivocal adoration: the letter is from a
wife to her husband, from a penitent to her spiritual guide—women
say such things every day in the confessional, even in this very
sensitive age—from a thoughtful woman to a man whom she knew to be
dead to every breath of sensual love. There is no parallel to such a
situation.</p>

<p>Further, it is now obvious that the romancists have done injustice
to the soul of Heloise in their isolation of her impassioned
phrases. She objectifies her love: she is not wholly merged in it.
She never loses sight of its true position in her actual life. It
is an evil, a temptation, a torment—she would be free from it. Yet
she is too rational a thinker to turn to the easy theory of an<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span> outward tempter. It
is part of herself, a true outgrowth of the nature God has given
her; and between the voice of nature and the voice of conscience,
complicated by the influence of conventual tradition and written law,
her soul is rent with a terrific struggle. A modern confessor with a
knowledge of physiology—there are a few such—could have led her into
paths of peace without difficulty. There was no sin in her.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say that Abélard sails faultlessly through
these troubled waters, but his answer to her on this point is true
and sound in substance. ‘God grant that it be so in thy soul as thou
hast written,’ he says in his next letter. It is true that he is
chiefly regarding her humility, and that he does not shed the kindly
light of human wisdom on her soul which an earlier Abélard would
have done; yet we can imagine what St. Bernard or Robert d’Arbrissel
would have answered to such an outpouring. However, apart from the
happy moderation of this reply, Abélard’s third letter only increases
our sympathy with this woman who wanders in the desert of the
twelfth century of the Christian era. The wild cry of the suffering
heart has startled him. He becomes painfully ingenious in defending
Provid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span>ence and
the monastic or Buddhistic view of life. As to his death, why should
she be moved so strongly? ‘If thou hadst any trust in the divine
mercy towards me, the more grievous the afflictions of this life seem
to thee the more wouldst thou desire to see me freed from them! Thou
knowest of a certainty that whoever will deliver me from this life
will deliver me from a heavy penalty. What I may incur hereafter I
know not, but there is no uncertainty as to that which I escape.’
And again, when he comes to her accusations of Providence: if she
would follow him to ‘the home of Vulcan,’ why cannot she follow him
quietly to heaven? As to her saying that God spared them in their
guilt and smote them in their wedded innocence, he denies the latter
point. They were not innocent. Did they not have conjugal relations
in the holy nunnery of the Virgin at Argenteuil?<a id="FNanchor_23"
href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Did he not profanely
dress her in the habit of a nun when he took her secretly to Pallet?
Flushed with the success of his apology for Providence, the unlucky
abbot goes from bathos to bathos. There was not merely justice but
love in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span>
divine ruling. They had merited punishment, but had, ‘on the
contrary,’ been rescued from the ‘vile and obscene pleasures’ of
matrimony, from the ‘mud and mire,’ and so forth. His mutilation was
a skilful operation on the part of Providence ‘to remove the root of
all vice and sordidness from him, and make him fitter for the service
of the altar.’ ‘I had deserved death, and I have received life. Do
thou, then, unite with me in thanksgiving, my inseparable companion,
who hast shared both my sin and my reward.’ How fortunate it was that
they married! ‘For if thou hadst not been joined to me in matrimony,
it might easily have happened that thou wouldst have remained in the
world’—the one thing that would have saved her from utter desolation.
‘Oh, how dread a loss, how lamentable an evil it had been, if in
the seeking of carnal pleasure thou hadst borne a few children in
pain to the world, whereas thou now bearest so great a progeny with
joy to heaven.’ Again the ‘mud and mire,’ and the thanksgiving. He
even lends his pen, in his spiritual ecstasy, to the writing of this
fearful calumny against himself: ‘Christ is thy true lover, not
I; all that I sought in thee was the satisfaction of my miserable
pleasure.’ Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span>
passions are, like the artificially stimulated ones of the deacons in
Gibbon and of Robert d’Arbrissel, a means of martyrdom. He had been
spared all this, she had plaintively written; on the contrary, he
urges, she will win more merit and reward than he.</p>

<p>I have given a full summary of the long epistle, because
its psychological interest is great. We have seen the gradual
transformation of Abélard—the steps in his ‘conversion’—from
chapter to chapter. This letter marks the deepest stage of his
lapse into Bernardism.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"
class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It offers an almost unprecedented contrast
to the Abélard of 1115. And this is the man, I may be pardoned for
repeating, who is held up by ecclesiastical writers (even such as
Newman) to the blushes of the ages. Perhaps the age is not far off
that will sincerely blush over him—not for his personal defects.</p>

<p>Heloise was silenced. Whether the pious dissertation had really
influenced her, or the proud utterance of her plaint had relieved
her, or she closed in upon her heart after such a reply, it<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span> would be difficult
to say. Her next letter is calm, erudite, dialectical. ‘To her
lord as to species, her beloved in person’ is the quaint heading
of the epistle. She will try to keep her pen within due bounds in
future, but he knows the saying about ‘the fulness of the heart.’
Nevertheless, ‘just as a nail is driven out by a new one, so it is
with thoughts.’ He must help her to dwell on other things. She and
her nuns beg him to write a new rule for them and a history of the
monastic life. There are points in the Rule of St. Benedict which are
peculiarly masculine; she discusses them in early mediæval style. She
would like her nuns to be permitted to eat meat and drink wine. There
is less danger in giving wine to women; and she naïvely quotes (from
Macrobius) Aristotle’s crude speculation on the subject. Then follows
a long dissertation on wine, temperance, and intemperance, bristling
with proofs and weighty authorities. Briefly, she quarrels with the
ascetic view of life. She happily avoids the hard sayings in which
Christ urges it on every page of the Gospels, and voices the eternal
compromise of human nature. Who may become Abélard’s successor as
their spiritual guide, she does not know. Let him appoint a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> rule of life for them,
which will guard them from unwise interference, and let it concede a
little in the way of soft clothing, meat, wine, and other suspected
commodities.</p>

<p>Abélard complies willingly, quite entering into the spirit of
the nail theory. ‘I will make a brief and succinct reply to thy
affectionate request, dear sister,’ he begins, at the head of a
very long and very curious sketch of the history of monasticism.
It is a brilliant proof of Abélard’s erudition, relatively to his
opportunities, but at the same time an illustration of the power of
constructing most adequate ‘explanations’ without any reference to
the real agencies at work.</p>

<p>In a later letter Abélard drew up the rule of life which had
been asked. It follows the usual principles and tendencies of such
documents. It offers, however, no little psychological interest in
connection with the modifications which the abbess has desired.
The dialectician feels a logical reluctance to compromise, and the
fervent monk cannot willingly write down half measures. Yet the human
element in him has a sneaking sympathy with the plea of the abbess,
and, with much explanation and a fond acceptance of Aristotelic
theories, the compromise is effected. To the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span> manuscript of this letter a later
hand has added a smaller and more practical rule. This is generally
attributed to Heloise herself, and is certainly the work of some
early abbess of the Paraclete. It supplements Abélard’s scheme of
principles and general directions by a table of regulations—as to
beds, food, dress, visitors, scandals, etc.—of a more detailed
character.</p>

<p>The closing letter of the famous series is one addressed by
Abélard to ‘the virgins of the Paraclete’ on the subject of ‘the
study of letters.’ It is from this epistle that we learn—as we
do also from a letter of Venerable Peter of Cluny—of Heloise’s
linguistic acquirements. The nuns are urged to undertake the study of
the Scriptural tongues, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and are reminded
that they have ‘a mother who is versed in these three languages.’
There is reason to think that neither master nor pupil knew much
Greek or Hebrew.</p>

<p>This is followed shortly by a number of hymns and sermons. Heloise
had asked him to write some hymns for liturgical use, so as to avoid
a wearisome repetition and to dispense with some inappropriate ones.
He sent ninety-three, but they are of little literary and poetic
value. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span> source
of his old-time poetic faculty is dried up. A sequence for the Feast
of the Annunciation, which is attributed to him, won praise from, of
all people, Luther. But the number of hymns and songs ‘attributed’
to Abélard is large. The sermons, of which thirty-four are to be
found in the collection of his works, are not distinguished in their
order. The abbot was not an eloquent preacher. But they are carefully
written, erudite compositions, which were delivered at St. Gildas,
or the Paraclete, or by special invitation. Some of them have much
intrinsic interest or value—those on Susannah and John the Baptist,
for instance, in connection with monastic affairs, and that on St.
Peter in connection with his rigid loyalty to Rome.</p>

<p>A more interesting appendix to the correspondence is found in
the forty-two ‘Problems of Heloise,’ with the replies of Abélard.
Under the pretext of following out his direction, but probably with
a greater anxiety to prolong the intercourse, Heloise sent to him
a list of difficulties she had encountered in reading Scripture.
The daughters of Charlemagne had responded to Alcuin’s exhortations
with a similar list. The little treatise is not unworthy of
analysis from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span>
the historico-theological point of view, but such a task cannot be
undertaken here. The problems are, on the whole, those which have
presented themselves to every thoughtful man and woman who has
approached the Bible with the strictly orthodox view; the answers
are, generally speaking, the theological artifices which served that
purpose down to the middle of the wayward nineteenth century.</p>

<p>With this mild outbreak of rationalism Heloise passes out of
the pages of history, save for a brief reintroduction in Abélard’s
closing year. The interest and the force of her personality have
been undoubtedly exaggerated by some of the chief biographers of
Abélard, but she was assuredly an able, remarkable, and singularly
graceful and interesting woman. Cousin once suddenly asked in the
middle of a discourse: ‘Who is the woman whose love it would have
been sweetest to have shared?’ Many names were suggested, though
there must have been a strong anticipation that he would name Mme. de
Longueville, for he laboured at that very time under his posthumous
infatuation for the sister of Condé. But he answered, Heloise,
‘that noble creature who loved like a St. Theresa, wrote sometimes
like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> Seneca,
and who must have been irresistibly charming, since she charmed
St. Bernard himself.’ It was a fine phrase to deliver impromptu,
but an uncritical estimate. It is a characteristic paradox to say
that she loved like a St. Theresa, and an exaggeration to say that
she ever wrote like Seneca. As to her charming St. Bernard—the
‘pseudo-apostle,’ as she ungraciously calls him,—they who read the
one brief letter he wrote her will have a new idea of a charmed man.
Yet with her remarkable ability, her forceful and exalted character
in the most devitalising circumstances, and her self-realisation, she
would probably have written her name in the annals of France without
the assistance of Abélard. It must be remembered that she had a very
singular reputation, for her age, before she met Abélard. She might
have been a St. Theresa to Peter of Cluny, or, as is more probable, a
Montmorency in the political chronicle of France.</p>

</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> literary and personal
activity described in the preceding chapter, together with the
elaboration of a new ‘theology,’ of which we shall read presently,
brings the story of Abélard’s life down to 1135 or 1136. His
movements during the three or four years after his flight from
St. Gildas are very obscure. St. Bernard seems to speak of his
presence in Paris at one time, though the passages can, and perhaps
should, be explained away. Heloise speaks of his visits to the
Paraclete. On the whole he probably remained in Brittany, at Nantes
or Pallet, and devoted his time to literary work. But in 1136 we
find him in Paris once more. Whether the monks succeeded in making
Brittany too insecure for him, or the count failed to guarantee his
income, or a natural disgust with the situation and longing for the
intellectual arena impelled him to return, we<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span> cannot say. It is only known that in
1136 he was once more quickening the scholastic life of Europe from
the familiar slope of St. Genevieve.</p>

<p>So swift and eventful has been the career of the great teacher
that one realises with difficulty that he is now almost an old man,
a man in his fifty-seventh or fifty-eighth year. It is twenty years
since the grim termination of his early Parisian activity, and a new
generation fills the schools. The ideas with which he first startled
and conquered the intellectual world have been made familiar. The
vigour, the freshness, the charming pertinacity of youth have
departed. Yet there is no master in Christendom, young or old, that
can restrain the flood of ‘barbarians’ when ‘Li mestre’ reappears
at Paris. John of Salisbury was amongst the crowd. It is from his
<i>Metalogicus</i> that we first learn of Abélard’s return to the arena,
and the renewal of his old triumph. St. Bernard fully confirms the
story, after his fashion. Indeed, in one sense Abélard’s triumph was
greater than ever, for he gathered a notable group of followers about
him on St. Genevieve. There was Arnold of Brescia, the scourge of the
Italian clergy, the ‘gad-fly’ of the hierarchy. There was Gilbert de
la Porée, a dreaded dialec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[p.
255]</span>tician and rationalistic theologian. There was Hyacinth,
the young deacon and noble from Rome, afterwards a power in the
sacred college. There was Bérenger, the caustic critic, who gave
Bernard many an unpleasant quarter of an hour. There were future
bishops and theologians in remarkable numbers.</p>

<p>However, we have no information of a definite character until five
years afterwards. In fact John of Salisbury complicates the situation
by stating that Abélard withdrew shortly after 1136. Deutsch thinks
that Abélard left Paris for a few years; Hausrath, on the contrary,
conjectures that he merely changed the locality of his school. John
of Salisbury would, in that case, have followed his lectures in the
cloistral school in 1136, and would have remained faithful to the
abbey, following Abélard’s successor, a Master Alberic, when Abélard
was, for some unknown reason, constrained to move his chair to the
chapel of St. Hilary, also on the slope of St. Genevieve. According
to the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i> it was at St. Hilary that Bernard
visited him in 1141. It is an ingenious way of keeping Abélard in
Paris during the five years, as most historians would prefer to do.
Its weak point is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span>
the supposition that John of Salisbury would continue to attend at
the abbey of St. Genevieve with Abélard teaching a few yards away.</p>

<p>The difficulty may be gladly left to the chronologist. The first
great fact in Abélard’s career after his return to Paris is that St.
Bernard begins to take an active interest in his teaching in the
spring of 1141. Ten short weeks afterwards the prestige of the great
teacher was shattered beyond recall, and he set out upon his pathetic
journey to the tomb. It was a tense, a titanic struggle, on the side
of Bernard.</p>

<p>According to the religious story-books the episode is very clear
and highly honourable to Bernard. Abbot Abélard had rewritten,
with what he thought to be emendations, the theological treatise
which had been burnt at Soissons. Under the title of the <i>Theologia
Christiana</i>, this rationalistic exposition and defence of the dogmas
of the faith, especially of the Trinity, had ‘crossed the seas and
leaped over the Alps,’ in Bernard’s vivid phraseology. With it
travelled also an <i>Introductio ad theologiam</i>, which was written
soon after it, and his <i>Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans</i>,
of earlier date. The books we have previously mentioned, the <i>Sic
et Non</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span> and
the <i>Ethics</i> or <i>Know Thyself</i>, had a more limited and secluded
circulation. The theological work which has the title of <i>Epitome
Theologiae Christianae</i> or <i>Sententiae Petri Abaelardi</i> is
considered by most experts to be a collection of his opinions drawn
up by some other masters for scholastic use.<a id="FNanchor_25"
href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The story runs that these works chanced to intrude on the pious
meditations of a mystic theologian of the name of William of St.
Thierry. William was very nearly a saint, and the new theology
shocked him inexpressibly. He had been abbot of St. Thierry at
Rheims, but had been elevated from the Benedictine level to the
Cistercian under Bernard’s influence, and was peacefully composing
a commentary on the highly mystical ‘Song of Songs,’ in the
Cistercian monastery at Signy, when Abélard’s heresies reached him.<a
id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In his
horror he selected thirteen definite heretical<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span> statements from the books, and sent
them, with the treatises, to his pious and powerful friend, Bernard
of Clairvaux, with a pressing request to examine them and take
action. Bernard replied that a cursory perusal of the books seemed
to justify his follower’s zeal. He would put the matter aside until
after Holy Week, then talk it over with William. In the meantime
William must bear patiently with his inactivity, since he ‘had
hitherto known little or nothing of these things.’ Easter over, and
the conference having presumably taken place, Bernard was convinced
of Abélard’s errors. Faithful to Christ’s direction, he went up
to Paris, and personally reproved his erring brother, without
witnesses. Bernard’s biographer (and secretary-monk) assures that
Abélard promised to amend his ways. The amendment not taking place,
Bernard paid him a second brotherly visit, and, as he refused to
comply, Bernard followed out the evangelical direction of reproving
him before others. He attacked him in the presence of his students,
warning the latter that they must burn his heretical writings
forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span>with. It
is one of the scenes in Abélard’s career which it would have been
interesting to have witnessed.</p>

<p>However, we must defer for a moment the continuation of the
Bernardist version of the encounter, and examine the course of events
more critically.</p>

<p>The theory that St. Bernard had not occupied himself with the
errors of Abélard until William of St. Thierry drew his attention
to them is a very poor and foolish composition. We could as well
imagine that Newman knew ‘little or nothing’ of Dr. Arnold’s views
in the early thirties. Bernard and Abélard had been for many
years the supreme representatives of the new ‘High’ and ‘Broad’
movements of the twelfth century; and Bernard had a far more intense
dread of rationalism than Newman. Scarcely an event of moderate
importance occurred in Church, school, or state, in France at least,
that escaped the eye of the abbot of Clairvaux in those days. He
was ‘acting-Pope’ to the Church of Christ, and he felt all the
responsibility. And, amongst the multitudinous cares of his office,
none gave him greater concern than the purity of the faith and the
purification of the disquieting scholastic activity of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span></p>

<p>We have seen in a former chapter how largely antithetic his
position was to that of Abélard, and that he was a man who could not
doubt for a moment the truth of his own conception of religion. There
was the same marked antithesis at the very bases of their theological
conceptions, in the mental soil in which those conceptions took
root. Bernard was more authoritative than Anselm of Laon, more
mystic than Anselm of Canterbury. He had gone further than Anselm
on the theory that ‘faith precedes reason’; Abélard had gone beyond
Roscelin with the inverse proposition. Perhaps Bernard’s commentary
on the ‘Song of Songs’ furnishes the best illustration of his frame
of mind and his outlook. Towards the close of his life he devoted
himself to long and profound meditation on that beautiful piece of
Oriental literature. We must not forget, of course, that the Church
is largely responsible for his extravagance on this point. It has
indeed taken the civilisation of the West more than two thousand
years to discover that its glowing verses are inspired only by the
rounded limbs and sweet breath of a beautiful woman; and its most
erotic passages are still solemnly applied to the Mother of Christ on
her annual festivals. But Bernard revelled in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span> its ‘mystic’ phrases. Day by day, for
more than a year, he gathered his monks about him in the <i>auditorium</i>
at Clairvaux, and expounded to them the profound spiritual meanings
of the ‘Song.’ Eighty-three long sermons barely exhausted the first
two chapters. In the end he devoted three lengthy discourses, on
successive days, to the elucidation of the words: ‘In my bed at night
I have longed for him whom my soul loveth.’</p>

<p>This mystic and unreasoning attitude brought him into fundamental
antagonism with Abélard. To him faith was the soul’s first duty;
reason might think itself fortunate if there were crumbs of knowledge
in the accepted writings which it could digest. To reason, to ask
a question, was honestly incomprehensible and abhorrent to him. He
insisted that the rationalist told God he would not accept what he
could not understand; whereas the rationalist was prevented by his
own logic from questioning the veracity of the Infinite, and merely
insisted that, in a world of hallucination and false pretence, it
were well to make sure that the proposition in question really did
come from God. Bernard thought reasoning about the Trinity implied
irreverence or incredulity; Abélard felt it to be a high service
to divine truth, in pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p.
262]</span>paring it for minds which were not blessed with the mystic
sense. Bernard believed Christ died purely and crudely to make amends
to the Father; Abélard thought this would impute vindictiveness to
God. And so on through a long list of dogmatic points which were of
unspeakable importance in the eyes of the twelfth century.</p>

<p>A conflict was inevitable. In Bernard’s thought Abélard was
employing an extraordinary ability to the grave prejudice of the
honour of God, the safety of the Church, and the supreme interest of
humanity. Bernard would have deserted his principles and his clear
subjective duty if he had remained silent. If he had ‘a quick ear’ to
catch ‘the distant thunder roll of free inquiry,’ as Cotter Morison
says, and no one questions, he must have turned his zealous attention
to Abélard long ago, as we have already seen. But the rationalist had
been rendered powerless in Brittany for some years. Now that he was
teaching with great effectiveness at Paris once more, Bernard could
not but take action.</p>

<p>However, it is a task of extreme difficulty for an impartial
student to trace with confidence the early stages of that memorable
conflict. We have seen the Bernardist version; the version of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span> some of the recent
biographers of Abélard is very different. Deutsch and Hausrath, able
and critical scholars, believe that the letter from William of St.
Thierry had been written, wholly or in part, by Bernard himself;
that Bernard’s reply was part of a comedy of intrigue; that a timid
and treacherous conventicle of the Cistercian monks, including
Bernard, had deliberately drawn up in advance this equivocal plan of
campaign. Now, if the Catholic enthusiast is incapable of dealing
quite impartially with such a problem, it is equally certain that the
heretic has a similar disturbing element in his natural predilection
for picking holes in the coats of the canonised. The evidence must be
examined very carefully. The presumption is that a man of the exalted
idealism and stern self-discipline of St. Bernard would not lend
himself to such manœuvres. Yet these things are not inconsistent with
the dignity of canonisation; moreover, the object was a great and
holy one—and Bernard had a mortal dread of the dialectician.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, it is impossible to credit Bernard
with the whole of the letter which bears the name of William of
St. Thierry. Much of it is by no means Bernardesque in style and
manner;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span> and
there are passages which it is quite impossible, on moral grounds,
to conceive as having been written by Bernard himself. At the same
time much of it does certainly seem to have been written by Bernard.
There are few better judges of such a point than Deutsch. The
contention that William would not have dared to address such a demand
simultaneously to Bernard and Geoffrey without instructions is more
precarious.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the letter seems in many respects to support
the idea of a diplomatic arrangement. It is addressed to Bernard and
to Geoffrey of Chartres, and opens as follows: ‘God knows that I am
filled with confusion, my lords and fathers, when I am constrained
to address you, insignificant as I am, on a matter of grave urgency,
since you and others whose duty it is to speak remain silent.’
After a little of this strain he recounts how he ‘lately chanced
to read a certain work’ of the dreadful heretic he has named—the
<i>Theology of Peter Abélard</i>. From it he selects thirteen heretical
propositions (we shall meet them later), which he submits to their
judgment. If they also condemn, he calls for prompt and effective
action. ‘God knows that I too have loved him’ [Abélard], he says,
‘and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span> would remain
in charity with him, but in such a cause as this I know no friend or
acquaintance.’ Finally, he says: ‘There are, I am told, other works
of his, the <i>Sic et Non</i> and the <i>Scito te Ipsum</i>, and others ... but
I am told that they shun the light, and cannot be found.’</p>

<p>Without straining an impressionist argument, it may be at
once pointed out that the letter betrays itself. Several of the
propositions in the list are not found in either of Abélard’s
theologies; they are taken from the works which William affirms he
has never seen. An intrigue is revealed; some other person, not at
Signy, has had an important share in the epistle, if not in the
actual writing of it. Again, as Neander says in his <i>Life of St.
Bernard</i>, the passage about his affection cannot be taken seriously;
he had been passionately devoted to Bernard for some years. The
letter is evidently written for use or publication, and reveals a
curious piece of acting.</p>

<p>Bernard’s reply is also clearly ‘part of the comedy,’ as
Hausrath says. Bernard is much addicted to <i>tutoyer</i> his friends,
even his lady friends.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> His previous letters to William, written
before he was a ‘son of religion’ and a devoted<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span> follower, are written in that familiar
style. But in this brief note ‘thou’ and ‘thine’ become ‘you’ and
‘your.’ ‘I consider your action both just and necessary. The book
itself, betraying the mouth of those that speak iniquity, proves that
it was not idle.... But since I am not accustomed, as you know well,
to trust my own judgment, especially in matters of such moment,’ it
must wait a little. He will see William about it after Easter. ‘In
the meantime be not impatient of my silence and forbearance in these
matters; most of them, indeed nearly all of them, were not known to
me before (cum horum plurima et pene omnia hucusque nescierim).’</p>

<p>The letter is almost incomprehensible, coming from such a man.
<i>He</i> take the first discovery of so influential a heretic so calmly;
<i>he</i> not trust his own judgment in such matters! Save for the
literary form, which is unmistakable, the letter is wholly out of
place in the bulky volume of Bernard’s correspondence. It is part
of the play; and its brevity and vagueness seem to indicate an
unwillingness or ethical discomfort on the part of the writer.</p>

<p>The closing sentence in it has given trouble even to Bernard’s
biographers, and must discon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p.
267]</span>cert every admirer of the great uplifter of the twelfth
century. Cotter Morison says ‘he must refer to the special details’
of Abélard’s teaching. It is impossible to acquit the words of the
charge of evasiveness and a half-conscious inaccuracy, even if they
be so interpreted. We have already given the general considerations
which compel us to think Bernard made himself fully acquainted with
Abélard’s opinions. We have already discussed the probability of his
share in the driving of Abélard into Brittany. Other indications
are not wanting. In 1132 Bernard was sent on a papal mission into
Burgundy; his companion was Joscelin, Abélard’s early rival. Bernard
attacks with some spirit the errors of an unnamed master in his
<i>Treatise on Baptism</i>; these errors are the opinions of Abélard. On
one occasion, indeed, they had a direct controversy. Bernard had
visited the Paraclete, and had criticised the way in which the nuns,
following Abélard’s direction, recited the Lord’s Prayer. Abélard had
inserted ‘supersubstantial’ for ‘daily.’ Heloise duly reported the
criticism, and Abélard flew to arms. The letter was characteristic. A
sweet and genial prelude, a crushing argumentative onslaught, and an
ironical inversion of the charge. ‘But let each<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span> do as he pleases,’ the rhetorician
concluded; ‘I do not wish to persuade any man to follow me in this.
He may change the words of Christ as he likes.’</p>

<p>However, we need not strain detailed indications. It is impossible
to think that Bernard was unacquainted with ‘novelties’ that
the echo of a great name had borne to the ends of the earth.<a
id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> When
we have seen the whole story of Bernard’s share in the struggle, it
will be easier to understand this letter. It is puerile to think
that we detract anything from the moral and spiritual greatness of
St. Bernard in admitting an occasional approach to the common level
of humanity. And there was present in strength that delusive ideal
which has led so many good men into fields that were foreign to their
native grandeur—the good of the Church.</p>

<p>There is no record of a conference with William of St. Thierry
after Easter. The pupil has played his part, and he now vanishes
completely from the theatre. But from the subsequent report which
was sent to the pope, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p.
269]</span> from the <i>Life of St. Bernard</i>, written by his admiring
secretary, we learn that Bernard visited Abélard in private, and
admonished him of his errors. The scene is unfortunately left to
the imagination; though the report we have mentioned speaks of a
‘friendly and familiar admonition.’ Bernard’s biographer would have
us believe that Abélard was quite subdued—the ‘rhinoceros’ was
tamed again—by Bernard’s brotherly address, and promised to retract
his errors. It is possible that Abélard put him off with amiable
generalities, but quite incredible that he made any such promise. We
need not speculate, with Hausrath, on the probability of interference
from his more ardent students. The episcopal report to the pope
does not mention any broken promise. It could have used such a
circumstance with great effect.</p>

<p>Then followed Bernard’s second visit and warning. It would be
difficult to say which dreaded the other more in these curious
interviews, but Bernard had convinced himself of his duty to
crush Abélard, and he was following out a very correct and
excellently-devised scheme. The Gospel required a twofold personal
correction of an erring brother, before he was denounced<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span> to the synagogue. The
second one was to have witnesses. Bernard therefore boldly admonished
Abélard in the presence of his students, and bade them burn the works
of their master. It is a thousand pities we have no Abélardist record
of these proceedings.</p>

<p>If Abélard said little during the conferences, he must have known
that he was rapidly approaching another, perhaps a supreme, crisis
in his life. He knew his Gospel, and he knew Bernard. The next step
was the denunciation to the synagogue. He had had an experience of
such denunciation, and he would certainly not expect a less insidious
attack from the abbot of Clairvaux, who had avoided his dialectical
skill so long. He determined to checkmate the Cistercians. Very
shortly afterwards Bernard was dismayed to receive a letter from the
Archbishop of Sens, in which he was invited to meet the redoubtable
dialectician at Sens in a few weeks’ time, and discuss the right
and wrong of their quarrel before the whole spiritual and temporal
nobility of France.</p>

<p>It was now a question of dialectics and rhetoric versus diplomacy;
though indeed we must credit Abélard—or his ‘esquire,’ as Bernard
calls Arnold of Brescia—with a fine diplomatic move in claim<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span>ing the discussion.
There are several reasons for thinking that the Bishop of Paris
was in Rome at the time, or the discussion should have been sought
at Notre Dame. The next <i>instantia</i> was the Archbishop of Sens,
and Abélard continued to assail that prelate until he was forced
to accept the petition. Not improbably it appealed to the sporting
instinct of old ‘Henry the Boar,’ a man of noble extraction, and of
extremely worldly life before he fell under the influence of the
ubiquitous Bernard. The quarrel of the two great luminaries of France
was now notorious. He could not well refuse to open the lists for a
superb trial by combat.</p>

<p>But Bernard had an entirely different theory of the condemnation
of a heretic. He trusted to his personal influence and immense
epistolary power. Abélard’s works were available, and were sufficient
for the grounding of a condemnation, he said. He was not merely
impatient of the implied doubt of the infallibility of his judgment;
he shrank nervously from the thought of such an encounter. He did not
conceal for a moment his dread of Abélard’s power. ‘I am a boy beside
him,’ he pleaded, ‘and he is a warrior from his youth.’ On the other
hand, if it became a ques<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p.
272]</span>tion of a diplomatic struggle for a condemnation of the
books at Rome, the positions would be exactly reversed. He refused to
enter the lists with Abélard.</p>

<p>In the meantime the day which the Archbishop of Sens had
appointed was rapidly approaching. It was the Octave of, or
eighth day after, Pentecost. On the Sunday after Whitsunday,
now dedicated to the Trinity, there was to be a brilliant
religious function in the cathedral at Sens. It was customary to
expose the relics to veneration on that day, and as Sens, the
metropolitan church of Paris<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and other important towns, had a very
valuable collection of relics, the ceremony attracted a notable
gathering of lords, spiritual and temporal. Louis <small>VII.</small>
was to be there, with the usual escort of French nobles: the
curiously compounded monarch had a profound veneration for relics,
and something like a passion for the ceremonies that accompanied
their translation, veneration, and so forth. All the suffragans of
the archbishop would be present, with a number of other bishops,
and abbots, clerics, and masters innumerable. Quite apart<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span> from the duel between
the greatest thinker and the greatest orator in Europe, there would
be a very important and weighty gathering at the cathedral on that
day. Abélard willingly assented. Bernard is fond of repeating in his
later letters that Abélard set to work ‘to summon his friends and
followers from all parts.’ We shall see that the only noteworthy
supporters of Abélard at Sens were pupils or masters from Paris,
which lay at a convenient distance. Bernard was shortly to lose his
serenity in a sea of rhetoric.</p>

<p>There is a minor quarrel as to whether Bernard reversed his
decision, and intimated his acceptance to the archbishop before
the day arrived. Father Hefele thinks he did so. It is, however,
clear that, in his letter to the pope afterwards, Bernard wishes to
convey the impression that he held out until the last moment, and
only yielded to the entreaties of his friends in actually presenting
himself.</p>

<p>We shall refer to this letter to Pope Innocent shortly, but it
is worth while to notice now the edifying picture he draws of his
own preparation in contrast with that of ‘the dragon.’ Abélard is
represented as feverishly whipping up his supporters, whilst Bernard
refuses to hear of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p.
274]</span> an encounter, not only on account of Abélard’s
world-famed skill in debate, but also because he thinks it improper
to discuss sacred things in this fashion. But friends represent that
the Church will suffer, and the enemies of Christ triumph. Wearily
and ‘without preparation’—trusting wholly in the divine promise
of inspiration—he presents himself on the appointed day before
‘Goliath.’</p>

<p>In point of historical fact there is no reason for thinking that
Abélard made any effort to gather supporters. The few we read of
accompanied him from Paris. He had scarcely a single friend in the
ranks of his ‘judges.’ On the other hand we <i>do</i> know that Bernard
himself sent out a strong and imperious ‘whip’ to his episcopal
supporters. There is a brief letter, contained in the <i>Migne</i>
collection, which was despatched to all the French bishops on whom
Bernard could rely for sympathy and support. They have heard, he
says, of his summons to appear at Sens on the Octave of Pentecost.
‘If the cause were a personal one,’ he goes on, ‘the child of
your holiness could perhaps not undeservedly look to your support
[patrocinium]. But it is your cause, and more than yours; and so I
admonish you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span>
the more confidently and entreat you the more earnestly to prove
yourselves friends in this necessity—friends, I should say, not
of me, but of Christ.’ And he goes on to prejudge the case in the
mind of the official judges with his rhetorical denunciation of
Abélard’s heresies. ‘Be not surprised,’ he concludes, ‘that I summon
you so suddenly and with so brief a notice; this is another ruse
of our cunning adversary, so that he might meet us unprepared and
unarmed.’</p>

<p>The consequence of the sending of this whip will be apparent when
we come to examine the composition of the gathering at Sens. It marks
the beginning of a period of most remarkable intrigue. The idyllic
picture of the poor abbot making his way at the last moment to the
assembly with a sublime trust in Providence and the righteousness of
his cause must be regarded again at the close of the next chapter.</p>

<p>Whether Bernard formally accepted the summons or not, therefore,
authentic information was conveyed to both sides that the debate
would take place. It will be readily imagined how profoundly stirred
the kingdom of France would be over such an expectation. The bare
qualities of the antagonists put the discussion leagues above<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span> any remembered or
contemporary event in the scholastic world; the object of the
debate—the validity of the new thought that was rapidly infecting
the schools—was a matter of most material concern. Deutsch has
a theory of the conflict which seems to be only notable as an
illustration of the profundity of the Teutonic mind. He opines
there may have been a political struggle underlying the academic
demonstration. Louis was just beginning his struggle with Rome over
the vexed question of investitures, and it is conceivable that the
Abélardists leaned to the side of the king, in opposition to Bernard
and the ‘ultramontanes.’ It is conceivable, but not at all probable.
Abélard’s sermon on St. Peter indicates a really ultramontane
sentiment; moreover, he has ever kept aloof from the political side
of life. His follower, Arnold of Brescia, would be likely enough
to fall in with any such regal design. Arnold was a young Luther,
of premature birth. Born in Italy at the beginning of the twelfth
century, he had travelled to France, and studied under Abélard, at
an early age. He returned to Italy, and assumed the monastic habit.
An enthusiastic idealist and a man of proportionate energy and
audacity, he soon entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p.
277]</span> upon a fiery crusade against the sins of the monks, the
clergy, and the hierarchy. He was driven from Italy in 1139, then
from Switzerland, and he had just taken refuge in Paris when Bernard
started his campaign. Since one of his most prominent theories was
that the higher clergy should be stripped of all temporal privileges
and possessions, his place is easily determined on the question
of investitures. However, it is most unlikely that he should have
dragged Abélard into these semi-political and dangerous questions.
And although Bernard most sedulously urges the association of the
hated Arnold with Abélard in his letters to Rome, he never mentions
a suspicion of such a coalition as Deutsch suggests; nor, in fine,
does the conduct of the secular arm give the least countenance to the
theory.</p>

<p>The conflict was inevitable, without the concurrence of
any political intrigue. Abélard and Bernard were the natural
representatives of schools which could no longer lie down in peace
in the fold of the Church. Abélard foresaw disaster to the Church
in the coming age of restless inquiry unless its truths could be
formulated in his intellectual manner. Bernard was honestly convinced
that Abélard was ‘preparing the way for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span> Anti-Christ.’ And it followed as a
further consequence that Bernard should wish to avoid the discussion
to which Abélard looked for salvation from the menace of the mystical
school.</p>

<p>It will appear presently that Bernard was less concerned with the
details of Abélard’s teaching than with his spirit. He, however,
dwells on them for controversial purposes, and they are certainly
full of interest for the modern mind. The point will be more fully
developed in a supplementary chapter. For the moment a brief glance
at them will be instructive enough. They differ a little in Bernard’s
letter from the list given by William of St. Thierry, but one cannot
even glance at them without noticing how remarkably this thinker
of the twelfth century anticipated the judgment of the nineteenth
century. His theses, like the theses of the advanced theology of
these latter days, indicate two tendencies—an intellectual tendency
to the more rational presentment of dogma, and an ethical tendency to
the greater moralisation of ancient dogma.</p>

<p>We have already seen a good illustration of this anticipation
of modern tendencies in Abélard’s treatment of the traditional
doctrines of heaven and hell respectively, and we shall see more
later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> on. Of the
fourteen specific points (thirteen in William’s letter) contained
in the present indictment, we may pass over most of those which
refer to the Trinity as without interest. Abélard’s phrases were
new, but he cordially rejected the Arianism, Nestorianism, and so
forth, with which Bernard insisted on crediting him. In the ninth
proposition, that the species of bread and wine remain in the air
after transubstantiation, and that adventurous mice only eat the
species, not the Body of Christ, Abélard enunciated an opinion which
has been widely adopted by modern Catholic theologians. In his second
proposition, that the Holy Ghost was the Platonic <i>anima mundi</i>,
Abélard was merely trying to save Plato from the damnation of the
Bernardists.</p>

<p>On the ethical side, Abélard’s theses (in their context in his
works) are truly remarkable. Thus the third, ‘That God can only
do those things which He actually does, and in the way and at the
time that He does them,’ and the seventh, ‘That God is not bound to
prevent evil,’ are obviously indications of an ethical attempt to
save the sanctity of the Infinite in view of the triumph of evil.
‘That Christ did not become Man for the purpose of saving us from
the yoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span> of the
devil’ is an early formulation of the familiar modern conception of
the Incarnation. ‘That God does not do more for the elect, before
they accept his grace, than for the damned,’ and ‘That we have
shared the punishment but not the guilt of Adam,’ are further clear
anticipations of the refined theology of modern times. ‘No man can
sin before he exists,’ said Abélard, to Bernard’s mighty indignation.
‘That God alone remits sin’ is heretical to the modern Catholic, but
the dogma was not completely born until the following century;<a
id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> ‘that
evil thoughts, and even pleasure, are not of themselves sinful, but
only the consent given to them,’ and ‘that the Jews who crucified
Christ in ignorance did not sin, that acts which are done in
ignorance cannot be sinful,’ express the universal opinion of even
modern Catholic theologians, in the sense in which Abélard held
them.</p>

<p>And ‘these,’ wrote Bernard, with fine contempt, to his friend,
Pope Innocent, ‘are the chief errors of the theology, or rather the
stultilogy, of Peter Abélard.’</p>

  <h2 title="CHAPTER XIII - THE FINAL BLOW">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
  <p class="subh2">THE FINAL BLOW</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">On the</span> 4th of June 1141,
the cathedral at Sens was filled with one of the strangest throngs
that ever gathered within its venerable walls. Church and state and
the schools had brought their highest representatives and their
motley thousands to witness the thrilling conflict of the two first
thinkers and orators of France. On the previous day the magnificent
ceremony of the veneration of the relics had taken place. At that
ceremony the abbot of Clairvaux had discoursed of the meaning and
potency of their act. And when the vast crowds of gentle and simple
folk had quickened and sobbed and enthused at his burning words,
he had ventured to ask their prayers for the conversion of an
unbeliever, whom he did not name.</p>

<p>Now, on the Monday morning, the great concourse had streamed
into the cathedral once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p.
282]</span> more, an intense eagerness flashing from the eyes of the
majority. The red Mass of the Holy Spirit had been chanted by the
clerics, and the clouds of incense still clung about the columns and
the vaulted roof of the church. King Louis sat expectant, and stupid,
on the royal throne; the Count de Nevers and a brilliant group of
nobles and knights standing beside and behind him. Opposite them
another gaily apparelled group presented Henry, Archbishop of Sens,
with five of his suffragan bishops; beside him sat Samson, Archbishop
of Rheims, with three suffragans. Mitred abbots added to the
splendour with their flash of jewels. Shaven monks, with the white
wool of Cîteaux or the black tunic of St. Benedict, mingled with the
throng of canons, clerics, scholastics, wandering masters, ragged,
cosmopolitan students, and citizens of Sens and Paris in their gay
holiday attire.</p>

<p>It was, at first sight, just such an assembly as Abélard had
dreamed of when he threw down the gauntlet to the Cistercian. But he
must have looked far from happy as he stood in the midst of his small
band of followers. As he passed into the cathedral, he had noticed
Gilbert de la Porée in the crowd, the brilliant master who was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span> to be Bernard’s next
victim, and he whispered smilingly the line of Horace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">‘It is thy affair when thy neighbour’s house is on fire.’</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0">With Abélard were the impetuous young master, Bérenger
of Poitiers; the stern, ascetic, scornful young Italian, Arnold of
Brescia, flashing into the eyes of the prelates the defiance that
brought him to the stake fourteen years afterwards; and the young
Roman noble, Hyacinth, who afterwards became cardinal.</p>

<p>Beside these, and a host of admiring nonentities, Abélard almost
looked in vain for a friendly face amidst the pressing throng. The
truth was that, as Rémusat says, ‘if Bernard had not prepared for
debate, he had made every preparation for the verdict.’ The whole
cathedral was with him. After his discourse of the preceding day, and
the rumours that had preceded it, the priest-ridden citizens of Sens
were prepared to stone the heretic, as the people of Soissons had
threatened to do. The students would be divided, according to their
schools. The monks longed to see the downfall of their critic. The
king—the man who was to bear to his grave ‘the curse of Europe and
the blessing of St. Bernard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[p.
284]</span>’—was not likely to hesitate. The Count de Nevers was a
pious, credulous noble, who afterwards became a Cistercian monk. Otto
of Freising says Count Theobald of Champagne was present, though
the report does not mention him; in any case he had fallen largely
under Bernard’s influence since his sister had gone down in the
<i>White Ship</i> in 1120. The clergy of Sens were with Bernard; their
motto was: ‘The church of Sens knows no novelties.’ Of the judges
proper, Geoffrey, Bishop of Chartres, was almost the only one who
could be termed neutral; and even he had now become greatly amenable
to Bernard’s influence. Archbishop Henry was completely in the hands
of Bernard, his converter, who scolded him at times as if he were
a boy. Archbishop Samson of Rheims owed his pallium to Bernard, in
the teeth of the king’s opposition; he was deprived of it some years
afterwards. Hugo of Mâcon, the aged Bishop of Auxerre, was a relative
of Bernard’s and a fellow-monk at Cîteaux. Joscelin of Vieri, Bishop
of Soissons, was the former teacher of Goswin, and the associate of
Bernard on a papal mission a few years before. Geoffrey, Bishop of
Châlons, Abélard’s former friend at St. Médard, had since been helped
to a bishopric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span> by
Bernard. Hatto, Bishop of Troyes, had been won to Bernard. Alvise,
Bishop of Arras, is said to have been a brother of Abbot Suger and
friend of Goswin. Of the only two other bishops present, Helias of
Orleans and Manasses of Meaux, we have no information.</p>

<p>In such an assembly the nerve of the boldest speaker might well
fail. Bernard had preached during the Mass on the importance of
the true faith. Then when the critical moment came, he mounted the
pulpit with a copy of the writings of Abélard, and the dense crowd,
totally ignorant, most probably, of previous events, which were known
only to the intimate friends of each combatant, held its breath for
the opening of the struggle. The frail, worn, nervous figure in the
flowing, white tunic began to read the indictment, but suddenly
Abélard stepped forth before the astonished judges, and, crying out:
‘I will not be judged thus like a criminal; I appeal to Rome,’ turned
his back on them and strode out of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Chroniclers have left to our imagination the confusion that
followed, and we may leave it to that of the reader. Although the
bishops afterwards made a show of disputing it, the appeal<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span> was quite canonical,
and was admitted at Rome. But it was a course which had not
entered into the thoughts of the most astute of them, and which
completely upset their plans. They could not now touch the person
of Abélard. Bernard, indeed, did not deprive the great audience of
the discourse he had ‘not prepared,’ although it was now quite safe
from contradiction. We have it, some say, in his later letter to the
pope, a most vehement denunciation and often perversion of Abélard’s
teaching. He gained an easy victory, as far as Sens was concerned.
The next day the prelates met together, condemned Abélard’s teaching
as heretical, and forwarded a report, submitting his person and his
works, to Rome.</p>

<p>The question why Abélard behaved in so extraordinary a manner has
had many answers. The answer of the godly, given by Bernard’s monkish
biographer, is of the transcendental order. Brother Geoffrey relates
that Abélard confessed to his intimate friends that he mysteriously
lost the use and control of his mind when Bernard began. Bishop
Otto of Freising says that he feared ‘a rising of the people.’ He
would be more likely to provoke one by thus affronting their great
cathedral and prelates. The true interpretation is that the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span> assembly was a play,
covering an unworthy intrigue, and he had been secretly informed of
it. The bishops had drawn up their verdict, over their cups, on the
preceding day.</p>

<p>Desperate efforts are made, of course, to destroy an
interpretation which does not leave the discredit on Abélard, but it
has now been based on incontrovertible evidence. In the first place
the bishops ingenuously confess it themselves in their eagerness to
evade a different accusation. In order to influence the judgment, or
rather the decision, of the pope, they told him that they had found
Abélard’s teaching to be heretical. How, then, were they to reconcile
this with the notice of Abélard’s appeal to Rome? ‘We had,’ they say
in their report, ‘already condemned him on the day before he appealed
to you.’ It matters little who wrote this report—whether Bernard<a
id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> or
Henry’s secretary—because it was signed by the bishops. They reveal
their secret conclave of the Sunday evening. Henry was particularly
anxious to justify them, at all costs, on the charge of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span> disregarding the
appeal, because he had been suspended by Innocent for that offence a
few years previously.</p>

<p>Again, in the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i>, attributed to John of
Salisbury, there is an account of Bernard’s attempt to secure the
condemnation of that other brilliant dialectician, Gilbert de la
Porée, in 1148. It is expressly stated that Bernard called the chief
personages together the night before the synod, and was leading them
to pronounce on Gilbert’s ‘errors,’ when an archdeacon of Châlons
spoiled his strategy. Further, the writer goes on to say that the
cardinals—there were a number present for the synod—were greatly
incensed with Bernard, and ‘said that Abbot Bernard had beaten Master
Abélard by a similar stratagem.’ It is not unlikely that they learned
the story from Hyacinth, the young Roman.</p>

<p>The classical witness to this over-night conclave is Abélard’s
pupil, Bérenger of Poitiers. Unfortunately, his narrative is marred
by obvious exaggerations and a careless, heated temper. It occurs
in an apology for Abélard, or an ‘open letter’ to Bernard, which he
wrote some months afterwards. After reminding Bernard of some of
the frivolities of his early youth, and much<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span> sarcastic comment on his actual
reputation, he gives what purports to be a detailed description of
the secret meeting. No one who reads it will take it literally. Yet
when, in later years, he was run down, like Gilbert and Arnold, by
the relentless sleuthhound, he made a partial retractation. What he
has written as to the person of ‘the man of God’ must, he says, be
taken as a joke. But a few lines previously he has appealed to this
very narrative in justification of his abuse of Bernard: ‘Let the
learned read my “Apology,” and they may justly censure me if I have
unduly blamed him [Bernard].’ It is not impossible that Bérenger
merely retracts such remarks as that about Bernard’s juvenile
‘cantiunculas.’ In any case, we may justly transcribe a portion of
the narrative, after these qualifications.</p>

<p>‘At length, when the dinner was over, Peter’s work was brought in,
and some one was directed to read it aloud. This fellow, animated
with a hatred of Peter, and well watered with the juice of the grape,
read in a much louder voice than he had been asked to do. After a
time you would have seen them knock their feet together, laugh, and
crack jokes; you would think they were honouring Bacchus rather than
Christ. And all the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p.
290]</span> the cups are going, the wine is being praised, the
episcopal throats are being moistened. The juice of the lethal drink
had already buried their hearts.... Then, when anything unusually
subtle and divine was read out, anything the episcopal ears were not
accustomed to, they hardened their hearts and ground their teeth
against Peter. “Shall we let this monster live?” they cried.... The
heat of the wine at length relaxed the eyes of all in slumber. The
reader continues amidst their snoring. One leans on his elbow in
order to sleep. Another gets a soft cushion. Another slumbers with
his head resting on his knees. So when the reader came to anything
particularly thorny in Peter, he shouted in the deaf ears of the
pontiffs: “Do you condemn?” And some of them just waking up at the
last syllable, would mutter: “We condemn.”’</p>

<p>It is not difficult to take off the due and considerable discount
from the youthful extravagance of Master Bérenger. Bernard’s
followers (in the <i>Histoire littéraire de la France</i>) say he had ‘too
noble a soul and too elevated a sentiment to stoop to the refutation
of such a work.’ He has never, at all events, essayed to rebut the
charge of procuring a verdict against Abélard on the day before<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span> the synod. Even in our
own days it is a familiar source of merriment in ecclesiastical and
monastic circles to see a group of prelates fervently following the
red Mass of the Holy Ghost as a preliminary to a discussion of points
which they have notoriously settled over their cups the night before.
Such a meeting of the bishops on the Sunday would be inevitable.
Bernard would inevitably be present, and Abélard infallibly excluded.
In any case, the evidence is too precise and substantial to be
rejected. Indeed, the story fully harmonises with our knowledge of
Bernard’s earlier and subsequent conduct. It is not ours to inquire
minutely how far Bernard was consistent with himself and his lofty
ideals in acting thus.</p>

<p>Bernard was defeated for the moment by the unexpected appeal from
the verdict of the unjust judges. But he knew well that Abélard had
avoided Scylla only to plunge into Charybdis. Abélard’s knowledge
of the curia was restricted to a few days’ acquaintance with it in
a holiday mood at Morigni. Arnold of Brescia probably urged his
own acquaintance with it in vain. Moreover many years had elapsed
since his name was inscribed by the side of that of Bernard in the
chronicle of Morigni. Bernard, the secluded<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span> contemplative, knew the curia well. He
hastened home, told his secretary to prepare for a journey across the
Alps, and sat down to write a batch of extremely clever epistles. The
battle was fought and won before Abélard had covered many leagues in
the direction of Italy.</p>

<p>The first document that Bernard seems to have written is the
report upon the synod which was sent to Innocent <small>II.</small>
in the name of the Archbishop of Rheims and his suffragans. Hausrath,
who is the least restrained by considerations of Bernard’s official
sanctity of all Abélard’s apologists, and others, hold that both
the reports of the proceedings, that of Samson and that of Henry
(for the two archbishops, with their respective suffragans, reported
separately to the pope), were written by Bernard. It is at least
clear that the Rheims report was drawn up by him. Mr. Poole says
this is admitted even by Father Hefele. Bernard’s style is indeed
unmistakable.</p>

<p>In this official document, therefore, the pope is informed, not
so much that a dispute about Abélard’s orthodoxy is referred to his
court, as that ‘Peter Abélard is endeavouring to destroy the merit
of faith, in that he professes himself able to comprehend by his
human reason the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span>
whole being of God.’ From this gross calumny<a id="FNanchor_32"
href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the writer passes on
to assure the pope that Abélard ‘is a great man in his own eyes,
ever disputing about the faith to its undoing, walking in things
that are far above him, a searcher into the divine majesty, a
framer of heresies.’ He goes on to recount that Abélard’s book had
been condemned and burnt once before, at Soissons, ‘because of the
iniquity that was found in it’; whereas every scholar in France knew
that it was condemned on the sole ground that it had been issued
without authorisation. ‘Cursed be he who has rebuilt the walls of
Jericho,’ fulminates the abbot of Clairvaux. Finally, he represents
Abélard as boasting of his influence at Rome. ‘This is the boast
of the man,’ he says, ‘that his book can find wherein to rest its
head in the Roman curia. This gives strength and assurance to his
frenzy.’ The sole object of his appeal is ‘to secure a longer
immunity for his iniquity. You must needs apply a swift remedy to
this source of contagion.’ And the monstrous epistle closes with a
trust that Innocent will do his part, and that swiftly, as they had
done theirs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> Thus
was the pope introduced, in a handwriting he had so many reasons to
respect, to Abélard’s appeal for consideration.</p>

<p>The second report, which is signed by Archbishop Henry and his
suffragans, and which may not have been drawn up by Bernard, is
more free from diplomatic turnings, but also gravely unjust to the
appellant. It gives the pope a lengthy account of the order of events
since the receipt of the letter of William of St. Thierry. From it
we have quoted the words in which the bishops themselves confess
the secret conclave on the Sunday. The bishops were affronted, it
says, by Abélard’s appeal, which was ‘hardly canonical,’ but they
were content with an examination of his doctrines (consisting of
Bernard’s vehement harangue) and found them to be ‘most manifestly
heretical.’ They therefore ‘unanimously demand the condemnation of
Abélard.’ To put the point quite explicitly, the pope is clearly to
understand that the Church of France has already dealt with Abélard.
It is not quite so insidious as the report which Bernard wrote, and
to which—sad sign of the growing quality of the Church—even Geoffrey
of Chartres lent his venerable name.</p>

<p>Bernard’s official task seemed to be at an end<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span> with the despatch of
the report. His profound and generous trust in the Holy Spirit would
lead one to expect a complete withdrawal from the quarrel into which
he had been so unwillingly forced. But Bernard’s conception of the
activity of the Holy Spirit, though equal in theoretical altitude,
was very different in practice from that of a Francis of Assisi. We
have amongst his works no less than three epistles that he wrote at
the time to Pope Innocent in his own name. One of them consists of
a few prefatory remarks to the list of Abélard’s errors. The two
others are of a much more personal and interesting character. It is
difficult to say whether, and if so, why, the two letters were sent
to the pope, but it is not necessary to determine this. Both were
certainly written by Bernard for the purpose.</p>

<p>The first letter is addressed ‘to his most loving father and
lord, Innocent, Sovereign Pontiff by the grace of God, from Brother
Bernard, called the abbot of Clairvaux.’ From the first line he aims
at determining the case in the pope’s mind. ‘It is necessary that
there be scandals amongst us—necessary, but assuredly not welcome.’
Hence have the saints ever longed to be taken from this troubled
world. Bernard is equally tired of life.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span> He knows not whether it be expedient
that he die, yet ‘the scandals and troubles’ about him are
pressing his departure. ‘Fool that I was to promise myself rest if
ever the Leonine trouble<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a> was quelled and peace was restored to the
Church. That trouble is over, yet I have not found peace. I had
forgotten that I still lingered in the vale of tears.’ His sorrow and
his tears have been renewed. ‘We have escaped the lion [Pierleone],
only to meet the dragon [Abélard], who, in his insidious way, is
perhaps not less dangerous than the lion roaring in high places. Did
I say insidious? Would indeed that his poisoned pages did lurk in
the library, and were not read openly in the streets. His books fly
in all directions; whereas they, in their iniquity, once shunned the
light, they now emerge into it, thinking the light to be darkness....
A new gospel is being made for the nations, a new faith is put before
them.’ After Pierleone it is useful to remind Innocent of his second
great <i>bête noire</i>. ‘The Goliath [Abélard] stalks along in his
greatness, girt about with that noble panoply of his, and preceded by
his weapon-bearer, Arnold of Brescia. Scale is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span> joined to scale, so closely that not
a breath can get between.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"
class="fnanchor">[34]</a> For the French bee [Abeille-ard] has
hummed its call to the Italian bee; and they have conspired together
against the Lord and his anointed.’ He must even deny them the merit
of their notoriously ascetic lives: ‘Bearing the semblance of piety
in their food and clothing, but void of its virtue, they deceive
many by transforming themselves into angels of light—whereas they
are devils.’ The pope must not be misled by rumours of Abélard’s
present fervour of life; he is ‘outwardly a Baptist, but inwardly a
Herod,’ Bernard assures him. Then follows a passage we have already
quoted. He tells the pope the edifying story of the archbishop’s
summons, his refusal, the entreaties of his friends, the gathering
of Abélard’s supporters, and his final resolve to go: ‘Yielding to
the counsel of my friends, I presented myself at the appointed time
and place, unprepared and unequipped, save that I had in mind the
monition: “Take ye no thought what and how ye shall speak.”’ Then
‘when his books had begun to be read [he does not say by whom], he
would not listen, but went out, appealing from the judges he had
chosen. These things I tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p.
298]</span> thee in my own defence, lest thou mayst think I have
been too impetuous or bold in the matter. But thou, O successor of
Peter, thou shalt decide whether he who has assailed the faith of
Peter should find refuge in the see of Peter.’ In other words, do not
allow Abélard to come to Rome, but condemn him unheard, on my word.
He ends with a final diplomatic <i>argumentum ad invidiam</i>. ‘Hyacinth
has done me much injury, but I have thought well to suffer it, seeing
that he did not spare you and your court when he was at Rome, as my
friend, and indeed yours, Nicholas, will explain more fully by word
of mouth.’</p>

<p>The second letter runs so largely on the same lines that it
is thought by some to have been sent to the pope instead of the
preceding, in which the reference to Hyacinth and the curia may have
been impolitic. ‘Weeping has the spouse of Christ wept in the night,’
it begins, ‘and tears are upon her cheeks; there is none to console
her out of all her friends. And in the delaying of the spouse, to
thee, my lord, is committed the care of the Shunammite in this land
of her pilgrimage.’ Abélard is a ‘domestic enemy,’ an Absalom, a
Judas. There is the same play upon the lion and the dragon, and upon
the scaly monster formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p.
299]</span> of Abélard and Arnold. ‘They have become corrupt and
abominable in their aims, and from the ferment of their corruptions
they pervert the faith of the simple, disturb the order of morals,
and defile the chastity of the Church.’ Moreover Abélard ‘boasts that
he has opened the founts of knowledge to the cardinals and priests of
the Roman curia, and that he has lodged his books and his opinions
in the hands and hearts of the Romans; and he adduces as patrons of
his error those who should judge and condemn him.’ He concludes with
an apostrophe to Abélard, which was well calculated to expel the
last lingering doubt from the mind of the pope. ‘With what thoughts,
what conscience, canst thou have recourse to the defender of the
faith—thou, its persecutor? With what eyes, what brow, wilt thou
meet the gaze of the friend of the Spouse—thou, the violator of His
bride? Oh, if the care of the brethren did not detain me! If bodily
infirmity did not prevent it! How I should love to see the friend of
the Spouse defending the bride in His absence!’</p>

<p>The third letter, a kind of preface to Bernard’s list of errors
and commentary thereon, is of the same unworthy temper, tortuous,
diplomatic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span>
misleading, and vituperative. It is not apparent on what ground
Hausrath says this commentary represents Bernard’s speech at Sens;
if it does so, we have another curious commentary on Bernard’s
affirmation that he went to the synod unprepared. However that may
be, the letter is a singular composition, when we remember that it
accompanied an appeal to a higher court, to which the case had been
reserved. It opens with a declaration that ‘the see of Peter’ is the
due and natural tribunal to which to refer ‘all scandals that arise
in the Kingdom of God’; a declaration which is hardly consistent with
the assurance, when it is necessary to defend their condemnation of
Abélard, that his appeal ‘seems to us wonderful.’ Then follows the
familiar caricature. ‘We have here in France an old master who has
just turned theologian, who has played with the art of rhetoric from
his earliest years and now raves about the Holy Scriptures [Abélard
had been teaching Scripture and theology for the last twenty-six
years]. He is endeavouring to resuscitate doctrines that were
condemned and buried long ago, and to these he adds new errors of his
own. A man who, in his inquiries into all there is in heaven above
or earth below, is ignorant of nothing save the word “I do<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span> not know.” He lifts his
eyes to the heavens, and peers into the hidden things of God, then
returns to us with discourse of things that man is not permitted to
discuss.’ This last sentence, considered as a charge by Bernard of
Clairvaux against others, is amusing. Bernard spent half his time in
searching the hidden things of God, and the other half in discoursing
of them. But Abélard conceived them otherwise than he.</p>

<p>Thus was the supreme judge instructed in his part, whilst the
foolish Abélard lingered idly in Paris, not improbably, as Bernard
says, boasting of his friends at the curia. It was very possible
that he had friends at Rome. Deutsch suspects the existence of a
faction in the sacred college, which was opposed to Innocent and the
Chancellor Haymerick, and would be favourable to Abélard. Bernard was
not the man to leave a single risk unchallenged—or to the care of the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>In the first place, therefore, he wrote a circular letter ‘to
all my lords and fathers, the venerable bishops and cardinals of
the curia, from the child of their holiness.’ His secretary was to
deliver a copy to each. ‘None will doubt,’ he says, ‘that it is your
especial duty to remove all scandals from the kingdom of God.’ The
Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span> Church is
the tribunal of the world: ‘to it we do well to refer, not questions,
but attacks on the faith and dishonour of Christ: contumely and
contempt of the fathers: present scandals and future dangers. The
faith of the simple is derided, the hidden things of God are dragged
forth, questions of the most sublime mysteries are rashly debated,
insults are offered to the fathers.’ They will see this by the
report. ‘And if you think there is just ground for my agitation, be
ye also moved’—and moved to take action. ‘Let him who has raised
himself to the heavens be crushed down to hell; he has sinned in
public, let him be punished in public.’ It is the fulmination of the
prophet of the age on the duty of the curia.</p>

<p>Then came eight private letters to cardinals of his acquaintance,
an interesting study in ecclesiastical diplomacy. To the chancellor
of the curia, Haymerick, he speaks chiefly of Abélard’s boast
of friends at court. He transcribes the passage from his letter
to Innocent; and he adds the earlier allusion to the Roman
deacon, Hyacinth, who was evidently a thorn in the side of the
officials of the curia. To Guido of Castello, afterwards Celestine
<small>II.</small>, who was known to be<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span> a friend of Abélard, he writes in
an entirely new strain. ‘I should do you wrong,’ he begins, ‘if I
thought you so loved any man as to embrace his errors also in your
affection.’ Such a love would be animal, earthly, diabolical. Others
may say what they like of Guido, but Bernard is a man who ‘never
judges anybody without proof,’ and he will not believe it. He passes
to a mild complaint that ‘Master Peter introduces profane novelties
in his books’; still ‘it is not I that accuse him before the Father,
but his own book.’ But he cannot refrain from putting just a little
<i>venenum in cauda</i>: ‘It is expedient for you and for the Church
that silence be imposed on him whose mouth is full of curses and
bitterness and guile.’</p>

<p>Cardinal Ivo, on the other hand, belongs to the loyal group.
‘Master Peter Abélard,’ he is told, ‘a prelate without dependency,
observes no order and is restrained by no order.... He is a Herod
in his soul, a Baptist in outward appearance.’ However, that is not
my business, says the diplomatist, ‘every man shall bear his own
burden.’ Bernard is concerned about his heresies, and his boast that
he will be protected by a certain faction in the curia. Ivo must do
his duty ‘in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span>
freeing the Church from the lips of the wicked.’ A young unnamed
cardinal is appealed to for support. ‘Let no man despise thy youth,’
begins the man who calls Abélard a ‘slippery serpent’; ‘not grey hair
but a sober mind is what God looks to.’ Another cardinal, who had
a custom of rising when any person entered his room, is playfully
approached with a reminder of this: ‘If thou art indeed a son of
the Church,’ the note ends, ‘defend the womb that has borne thee
and the breasts that have suckled thee.’ Guido of Pisa receives a
similar appeal: ‘If thou art a son of the Church, if thou knowest
the breast of thy mother, desert her not in her peril.’ The letter
to another Cardinal Guido is particularly vicious and unworthy. ‘I
cannot but write you,’ it begins, ‘of the dishonour to Christ, the
trials and sorrows of the Church, the misery of the helpless, and
groans of the poor.’ What is the matter? This: ‘We have here in
France a monk who observes no rule, a prelate without care, an abbot
without discipline, one Peter Abélard, who disputes with boys and
busies himself with women.’ There is a nasty ambiguity in the last
phrase. Again, ‘We have escaped the roar of the lion [Pierleone] only
to hear the hissing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p.
305]</span> dragon Peter.... If the mouth of the wicked be not
closed, may He who alone regards our works consider and condemn.’
A similar letter is addressed to Cardinal Stephen of Praeneste. ‘I
freely write to you, whom I know to be a friend of the spouse, of the
trials and sorrows of the spouse of Christ.’ Abélard is ‘an enemy
of Christ,’ as is proved, not only by his works, but by ‘his life
and actions.’ He has ‘sallied forth from his den like a slippery
serpent’; he is ‘a hydra,’ growing seven new heads where one has been
cut off. He ‘misleads the simple,’ and finally ‘boasts that he has
inoculated the Roman curia with the poison of his novelty.’</p>

<p>A ninth letter is addressed to an abbot who was in Rome at the
time, and who is drawn into the intrigue with many holy threats.
‘If any man is for the Lord let him take his place. The truth is
in danger. Peter Abélard has gone forth to prepare the way for
Anti-Christ.... May God consider and condemn, if the mouth of the
wicked be not closed forthwith.’</p>

<p>These letters were handed over, for personal delivery, to
Bernard’s monk-secretary, Nicholas; in many of them it is expressly
stated that the bearer will enlarge upon the text more freely
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span> word of
mouth. We know enough about this monk to be assured of the more than
fidelity with which he accomplished his task. Enjoying the full
confidence of Bernard at that time, a very able and well-informed
monk, Nicholas de Montier-Ramey was a thorough scoundrel, as Bernard
learned to his cost a few years afterwards. He had to be convicted
of forging Bernard’s seal and hand for felonious purposes before the
keen scent of the abbot discovered his utter unscrupulousness.</p>

<p>With Abélard lingering at Paris in his light-hearted way, the
violence and energy of Bernard swept away whatever support he might
have counted on at Rome. Throughout the curia Bernard had scattered
his caricature of Abélard: a lawless monk, an abbot who neglected his
abbey, a man of immoral life, an associate of the recognised enemies
of the papacy, already condemned for heresy, a reviver of Arius and
Nestorius and Pelagius, a teacher without reverence, a disturber of
the faith of the simple. The pope did not hesitate a moment; the
letters sent to him are masterpieces of diplomatic correspondence.
The waverers in the curia were most skilfully worked. In mere secular
matters such an attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p.
307]</span> corrupt the judges would be fiercely resented. Bernard
lived in a transcendental region, that Hegelian land in which
contradictions disappear.</p>

<p>It was on the 4th of June that Abélard appealed to Rome. There
were no Alpine tunnels in those days, and the journey from Paris
to Rome was a most formidable one. Yet Bernard’s nervous energy
had infused such spirit into the work, and he had chosen so able a
messenger, that the whole case was ended in less than seven weeks.
There cannot have been a moment’s hesitation at Rome. On the 16th
of July the faithful of Rome gathered about the door of St. Peter’s
for the solemn reading of the decree of excommunication. The pope
was there, surrounded by his cardinals, and it was announced, with
the usual impressive flourishes, that Abélard’s works were condemned
to the flames and his person to be imprisoned by the ecclesiastical
authorities. Rome has not been a model of the humane use of power,
but she has rarely condemned a man unheard. On the sole authority
of Bernard the decree recognised in Abélard’s ‘pernicious doctrine’
the already condemned errors of the early heresiarchs. Arnold of
Brescia, who had not been officially indicted, was included in
the condemnation. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p.
308]</span> Bernard’s skilful use of his association with Abélard
which chiefly impelled the pope. Innocent replies to Bernard’s
appeal by sending back to him the decree of the condemnation of his
antagonist, with a private note to the effect that it must not be
published until after it has been read at an approaching synod.</p>

  <p class="subh2">CONSUMMATUM EST</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">It was</span> well for Bernard’s
cause that he succeeded in obtaining the decree without delay. He had
carefully represented that the whole of France supported him in his
demand. It does seem as if some of Abélard’s friends were puzzled
for a time by his appeal, but before long there came a reaction in
his favour, just as had happened after his condemnation at Soissons.
Bernard himself may have been perfectly self-justified in his
determined effort to prevent Abélard from having a fair chance of
defending himself, but there are two ways of regarding his conduct.<a
id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Abélard’s followers naturally adopted the view<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span> which was less flattering to Bernard’s
reputation, and they seem to have had some success in enforcing it.
In a letter of Bernard’s to a certain cardinal we find him defending
himself against the charge of ‘having obtained the decree by improper
means [<i>subripere</i>] from the pope.’</p>

<p>One of the chief instruments in the agitation on the Abélardist
side was the apology of Bérenger of Poitiers, which we have quoted
previously. Violent and coarse as it was, it was known to have a
foundation of fact; and, in the growing unpopularity of Bernard, it
had a wide circulation. It was not answered, as the Benedictines say;
yet we may gather from Bérenger’s qualified withdrawal of it, when
he is hard pressed, that it gave Bernard and the Cistercians a good
deal of annoyance. Arnold of Brescia was, meanwhile, repeating his
fulminations at Paris against the whole hierarchical system. He had
taken Abélard’s late chair in the chapel of St. Hilary on the slope
of St. Genevieve, and was sustaining the school until the master
should return from Rome in triumph. But Arnold had no hope of any
good being done at Rome, and rather preached rebellion against the
whole of the bejewelled prelates. Sternly ascetic in his life and
ideals—St. Bernard scoffingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[p.
311]</span> applies to him the evangelical description of the
Baptist: ‘He ate not, neither did he drink’—he was ever contrasting
the luxurious life of the pastors of the Church with the simple
ideal of early Christianity. He had not such success in France as
elsewhere, and Bernard secured his expulsion a few years later. But
the same stern denunciation was on his noble lips when the savage
flames sealed them for ever, under the shadow of St. Peter’s, in
1155.</p>

<p>Abélard himself seems to have taken matters with a fatal
coolness, whilst his adversary was moving heaven and earth to
destroy him. He allowed a month or two to elapse before he turned
in the direction of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Secure in the consciousness of the
integrity of his cause and his own power of pleading, and presuming
too much of Rome’s proud boast that it ‘condemned no man unheard,’
he saw no occasion for hurry. Late in the summer he set out upon
his long journey. It was his purpose to travel through Burgundy and
Lyons, and to cross the Alps by the pass which was soon to bear
the name of his energetic enemy. After the fashion of all<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span> travellers of the
time he rested at night in the monastery nearest to the spot where
he was overtaken. Thus it came to pass that, when he arrived in
the neighbourhood of Mâcon, he sought hospitality of the great and
venerable Benedictine abbey at Cluny.</p>

<p>Peter the Venerable, abbot of Cluny, was the second monk in France
at that time. A few degrees lower in the scale of neural intensity
than his canonised rival, he far surpassed him in the less exalted
virtues of kindliness, humanity, and moderation. ‘The rule of St.
Benedict,’ he once wrote to Bernard, ‘is dependent on the sublime
general law of charity’; that was not the route to the honour of
canonisation. He belonged by birth to the illustrious family of the
Montboissiers of Auvergne, and was a man of culture, fine and equable
temper, high principle, gentle and humane feeling, and much practical
wisdom. He had had more than one controversy with the abbot of
Clairvaux, and his influence was understood to counterbalance that of
Bernard at times in the affairs of the Church and the kingdom.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, one of the few fortunate accidents of his
career that brought Abélard to Cluny at that time. Abbot Peter knew
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span> Bernard
had actually in his possession the papal decree which ordered the
imprisonment of Abélard and the burning of his books. He had a deep
sympathy for the ageing master who was seeking a new triumph in Rome
under such peculiarly sad circumstances. Peter knew well how little
the question of heresy really counted for in the matter. It was a
question of Church politics; and he decided to use his influence
for the purpose of securing a tranquil close for the embittered
and calumniated life. Abélard was beginning to feel the exactions
of his journey, and remained some days at the abbey. The abbot, as
he afterwards informs the pope, spoke with him about his purpose,
and at length informed him that the blow had already fallen. It
was the last and decisive blow. The proud head never again raised
itself in defiance of the potent ignorance, the crafty passion, and
the hypocrisy that made up the world about him. He was too much
enfeebled, too much dispirited, even to repeat the blasphemy of his
earlier experience: ‘Good Jesus, where art thou?’ For the first and
last time he bowed to the mystery of the triumph of evil.</p>

<p>Abbot Peter then undertook the task of avert<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span>ing the consequence of Bernard’s
triumph, and found little difficulty in directing the fallen man.
It was imperative, in the first place, to effect some form of
reconciliation between the great antagonists, so as to disarm the
hostility of Bernard. We shortly find Raynard, the abbot of Cîteaux,
at Cluny, and Abélard accompanies him back to his abbey. Peter has
obtained from him a formal promise to correct anything in his works
that may be ‘offensive to pious ears,’ and on this basis Bernard is
invited to a reconciliation at Cîteaux. A few days afterwards Abélard
returns to Cluny with the laconic reply that they ‘had had a peaceful
encounter,’ as the abbot informs the pope, to whom he immediately
writes for permission to receive Abélard into their community at
Cluny, adding, with a calm contempt of the accusation of heresy,
that ‘Brother Peter’s knowledge’ will be useful to the brethren. The
abbot of Cluny had claims upon the pope’s consideration. Although the
anti-pope, Anacletus, had been a monk of Cluny, Peter had been the
first to meet Innocent when he came to France for support. In pointed
terms he begged that Abélard ‘might not be driven away or troubled by
the importunity of any persons.’ His request<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span> was granted; and thus the broken spirit
was spared that ‘public humiliation’ in France that Bernard had
demanded.</p>

<p>The basis of reconciliation with Bernard was probably a second and
shorter apology which Abélard wrote at Cluny. It was convenient to
regard this at the time as a retractation. In reality it is for the
most part a sharp rejection of Bernard’s formulation of his theses
and a new enunciation of them in more orthodox phraseology. His frame
of mind appears in the introductory note.</p>

<p>‘There is a familiar proverb that “Nothing is said so well that it
cannot be perverted,” and, as St. Jerome says, “He who writes many
books invites many judges.” I also have written a few things—though
little in comparison with others—and have not succeeded in escaping
censure; albeit in those things for which I am so gravely charged
I am conscious of no fault, nor should I obstinately defend it,
if I were. It may be that I have erred in my writings, but I call
God to witness and to judge in my soul that I have written nothing
through wickedness or pride of those things for which I am chiefly
blamed.’</p>

<p>Then, warmly denying Bernard’s charge that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span> he has ever taught a secret doctrine,
he passes to a detailed profession of faith on the lines of Bernard’s
list of errors. With regard to the Trinity he denies all the heresies
ascribed to him; this he could do with perfect justice. On the other
points he makes distinctions, adds explanations and qualifications,
and even sometimes accepts Bernard’s thesis without remark, though
one can generally see a reserve in the background. Thus, on the
question of sin committed in ignorance, he makes the familiar modern
distinction between culpable and inculpable ignorance: he admits
that we have inherited Adam’s sin, but adds ‘because his sin is the
source and cause of all our sins.’ On the question of the prevention
of evil by God, he merely says, ‘Yes, He often does’; and so forth.
The only sentence which looks like a real retractation is that in
which he grants ‘the power of the keys’ to all the clergy. In this
he clearly dissociates himself from Arnold of Brescia, and perplexes
his friends. But his earlier teaching on the point is by no means
so clear and categorical as that of Arnold. There is nothing either
very commendable or very condemnable about the document. It probably
represents a grudging concession to the abbot<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span> of Cluny’s friendly pressure and
counsel to withdraw from what was really only a heated quarrel
with as little friction as possible. That Abélard was not in the
penitent mood some writers discover in the letter is clear from the
peroration. ‘My friend [!] has concluded his list of errors with the
remark: “They are found partly in Master Peter’s book of theology,
partly in his <i>Sentences</i>, and partly in his <i>Scito te Ipsum</i>.” But I
have never written a book of <i>Sentences</i>, and therefore the remark is
due to the same malice or ignorance as the errors themselves.’</p>

<p>However, the document had a sufficient air of retractation about
it to allow Bernard to withdraw. In substance and spirit it was, as
its name indicated, an apology, not a retractation. In fact Bernard’s
zealous secretary and an unknown abbot attacked the apology, but
Abélard made no reply, and the discussion slowly died away. Bernard
had won a political triumph, and he showed a becoming willingness
to rest content with empty assurances. Abélard’s personal force was
dead; little eagerness was shown to pursue the seminal truths he had
left behind, and which were once thought so abhorrent and pernicious.
Later Benedictines virtually admit the justice of this.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span> Mabillon says: ‘We do
not regard Abélard as a heretic; it is sufficient for the defence of
Bernard to admit that he erred in certain things.’ And the historian
Noël Alexandre also says, ‘He must not be regarded as a heretic.’
Indeed, Bernard was strongly condemned at the time by English
and German writers. Otto of Freising reproves his action in the
cases of both Abélard and Gilbert, and attributes it to defects of
character. John of Salisbury severely criticises him in the <i>Historia
Pontificalis</i>; and Walter Map, another English writer, voices the
same widespread feeling.</p>

<p>Another document that Abélard sent out from Cluny forms the last
page of his intercourse with Heloise. If he had wearily turned away
from the strange drama of life, his affection for her survives the
disillusion in all its force. There is a welcome tenderness in
his thought of her amidst the crushing desolation that has fallen
upon him. <i>She</i> shall not be hurt by any unwilling impression of
persistent calumny. He writes to her a most affectionate letter,
and in the sanctuary of their love makes a solemn profession of the
purity of his faith.</p>

<p>‘My sister Heloise, once dear to me in the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span> world, and now most dear in Christ,
logic has brought the enmity of men upon me. For there are certain
perverse calumniators, whose wisdom leads to perdition, that say I
take pre-eminence in logic but fail egregiously in the interpretation
of Paul; commending my ability, they would deny me the purity of
Christian faith.... I would not rank as a philosopher if it implied
any error in faith; I would not be an Aristotle if it kept me away
from Christ. For no other name is given to me under heaven in which I
may find salvation. I adore Christ, sitting at the right hand of the
Father.’ Then follows a brief confession of faith on the chief points
of Christian belief—the Trinity, the Incarnation, baptism, penance,
and the resurrection. ‘And that all anxiety and doubt may be excluded
from thy heart,’ he concludes, ‘do thou hold this concerning me, I
have grounded my conscience on that rock on which Christ has built
His Church.’</p>

<p>It was Abélard’s farewell to her who had shared so much of the joy
and the bitterness of his life. But what a different man it recalls
through the mists of time from the ‘dragon’ of Bernard’s letters! One
contrast at least we cannot fail to note between the saint and the
sinner. We have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span>
seen Bernard’s treatment of Abélard; in this private letter,
evidently intended for no eye but that of his wife, we have the sole
recorded utterance of Abélard on the man who, for so little reason,
shattered the triumph and the peace of his closing years.</p>

<p>For if there is a seeming peace about the few months of life that
still remained to the great teacher, it is the peace of the grave—the
heavy peace that shrouds a dead ambition and a broken spirit, not the
glad peace that adorns requited labour and successful love. Abélard
enters upon a third stage of his existence, and the shadow of the
tomb is on it. He becomes a monk; he centres all his thought on the
religious exercises that, like the turns of the prayer wheel, write
the long catalogue of merit in heaven.</p>

<p>In the abbey of Cluny, under the administration of Peter the
Venerable, he found all that his soul desired in its final stage.
The vast monastery had a community of four hundred and sixty monks.
Older than its rival, Cîteaux, possessed of great wealth and one of
the finest churches in France, it was eagerly sought by monastic
aspirants. When Innocent <small>II.</small> came to France for
support, Cluny sent sixty horses and mules<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span> to meet him, and entertained him and
all his followers for eleven days. At an earlier date it had lodged
pope, king, and emperor, with all their followers, without displacing
a single monk. Yet with all its wealth and magnitude the abbey
maintained a strict observance of the rule of St. Benedict. Peter was
too cultured and humanistic<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a> for the Cistercians, who often criticised
the half-heartedness of his community. In point of fact a strict
order and discipline were maintained in the abbey, and Abélard
entered fervently into its life. From their beds of straw the monks
would rise at midnight and proceed to the church, where they would
chant their long, dirge-like matins, and remain in meditation until
dawn. Work, study, and prayer filled up the long hours; and at night
they would cast themselves down, just as they were, on the bags of
straw, to rise again on the morrow for the same task. Such monks—they
are rare now, though far from extinct—must be men of one idea—heaven.
To that stage had Abélard sunk.</p>

<p>Years afterwards the brothers used to point out to visitors—for
Abélard had left a repute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p.
322]</span> for sanctity behind him—a great lime-tree under which
he used to sit and read between exercises. Peter had gone so far as
to make him prior of the studies of the brethren, so lightly did
he hold the charge of heresy. The abbot has given us, in a later
letter to Heloise, an enthusiastic picture, drawn from the purely
Buddhist point of view, of Abélard’s closing days. With a vague
allusion to this letter certain ecclesiastical writers represent
Abélard as a sinner up to the time of the Council of Sens, and a
convert and penitent in the brief subsequent period. In point of
fact there was little change in the soul of the fallen man, beyond
a weary resignation of his hope of cleansing the Church, involving,
as this did, a more constant preoccupation with the world to come.
The abbot says, in support of his declaration, that Abélard had
cast a radiance on their abbey, that ‘not a moment passed but he
was either praying or reading or writing or composing’; and again:
‘If I mistake not I never saw his equal in lowliness of habit and
conduct, so much so that Germain did not seem more humble nor Martin
poorer than he to those who were of good discernment.’ The ‘good
discernment’ reminds us that we must not take at too literal a value
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span> letter of
comfort to the widowed abbess. Abélard had been an ascetic and a
devout man since his frightful experience at Paris twenty-five years
previously. With the fading of his interest in the things of earth,
and in his sure consciousness of approaching death, his prayers would
assuredly be longer and his indifference to comfort and honour more
pronounced.</p>

<p>But we have a clear indication that there was no change in his
thoughts, even in that last year, with regard to the great work of
his life and the temper of his opponents. During the quiet months of
teaching at Cluny, a certain ‘Dagobert and his nephew’ asked him for
a copy of his dialectical treatise, one of his earliest writings. It
is impossible to say whether this Dagobert was his brother at Nantes
(where Astrolabe also seems to have lived) or a monastic ‘Brother
Dagobert.’ Most probably it was the former, because he speaks of the
effort it costs him, ill and weary of writing as he is, to respond
to their ‘affection.’ He does not copy, but rewrites his dialectics,
so that we have in the work his last attitude on his studies and his
struggles. It is entirely unchanged. Jealousy, hatred, and ignorance
are the sole sources of the hostility to his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span> work. They say he should have confined
himself to dialectics (as Otto von Freising said later); but he
points out that his enemies quarrelled even with his exclusive
attention to dialectics, firstly because it had no direct relation to
faith, and secondly because it was indirectly destructive of faith.
He has still the old enthusiasm for reason and for the deepening and
widening of our natural knowledge. Both knowledge and faith come from
God, and cannot contradict each other. It was the last gleam of the
dying light, but it was wholly unchanged in its purity.</p>

<p>With the approach of spring the abbot sent the doomed man to a
more friendly and familiar climate. Cluny had a priory outside the
town of Chalon-sur-Saône, not far from the bank of the river. It
was one of the most pleasant situations in Burgundy, in the mild
valley of the Seine, which Abélard had learned to love. But the last
struggle had exhausted his strength, and the disease, variously
described as a fever and a disease of the skin, met with little
resistance. He died on the 21st of April 1142, in the sixty-third
year of his age.</p>

<p>How deeply he had impressed the monks of St. Marcellus during
his brief stay with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p.
325]</span> becomes apparent in the later history, which recalls the
last chapter in the lives of some of the most popular saints. It will
be remembered that Abélard had, in one of his letters to Heloise,
asked that his body might be buried at the Paraclete, ‘for he knew no
place that was safer or more salutary for a sorrowing soul.’ Heloise
informed the abbot of Cluny of the request, and he promised to see
it fulfilled. But he found that the monks of St. Marcellus were
violently opposed to the idea of robbing them of the poor body that
had been hunted from end to end of France whilst the great mind yet
dwelt in it. There have often been such quarrels, sometimes leading
to bloodshed, over the bodies of the saints. However, the abbot found
a means to steal the body from the monastery chapel in the month of
November, and had it conveyed secretly, under his personal conduct,
to the Paraclete.</p>

<p>We have a letter which was written by the abbot about this time
to Heloise. I have already quoted the portion in which he consoles
her with a picture of the edifying life and death of her husband. The
first part of the letter is even more interesting in its testimony to
the gifts and character of the abbess herself. Peter the Vener<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span>able was, it will be
remembered, a noble of high origin, an abbot of great and honourable
repute, a man of culture and sober judgment.</p>

<p>‘For in truth,’ he says, after an allusion to some gifts—probably
altar-work—that she had sent him, ‘my affection for thee is not of
recent growth, but of long standing. I had hardly passed the bounds
of youth, hardly come to man’s estate, when the repute, if not yet
of thy religious fervour, at least of thy becoming and praiseworthy
studies, reached my ears. I remember hearing at that time of a
woman who, though still involved in the toils of the world, devoted
herself to letters and to the pursuit of wisdom, which is a rare
occurrence.... In that pursuit thou hast not only excelled amongst
women, but there are few men whom thou hast not surpassed.’ He passes
to the consideration of her religious ‘vocation,’ in which, of
course, he discovers a rich blessing. ‘These things, dearest sister
in the Lord,’ he concludes, ‘I say by way of exhortation, not of
flattery.’ Then, after much theological and spiritual discussion, he
says: ‘It would be grateful to me to hold long converse with thee
on these matters, because I not only take pleasure in thy renowned
erudi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span>tion, but I
am even more attracted by that piety of which so many speak to me.
Would that thou didst dwell at Cluny!’</p>

<p>This is the one woman (and wife, to boot) to whom Bernard could
have referred in justification of his equivocal remark to a stranger
that Abélard ‘busied himself with women.’ We have, however, little
further record of the life of the unfortunate Heloise. Shortly
after the body of her husband has been buried in the crypt of their
convent-chapel, we find her applying to Peter of Cluny for a written
copy of the absolution of Abélard. The abbot sent it; and for long
years the ashes of the great master were guarded from profanation by
this pitiful certificate of his orthodoxy. In the same letter Heloise
thanks the abbot for a promise that the abbey of Cluny will chant
the most solemn rites of the Church when her own death is announced
to them; she also asks Peter’s favourable influence on behalf of
Astrolabe, her son, who has entered the service of the Church.</p>

<p>Heloise survived her husband by twenty-one years. There is a
pretty legend in the Chronicle of the Church of Tours that the tomb
of Abélard was opened at her death and her remains laid in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> it, and that the arms
of the dead man opened wide to receive her whose embrace the hard
world had denied him in life. It seems to have been at a later date
that their ashes were really commingled. At the Revolution the
Paraclete was secularised, and the remains of husband and wife began
a series of removals in their great sarcophagus. In 1817 they found a
fitting rest in Père Lachaise.</p>

  <p class="subh2">THE INFLUENCE OF ABÉLARD</p>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">If the</span> inquirer into the
influence of the famous dialectician could content himself with
merely turning from the study of Abélard’s opinions to the towering
structure of modern Catholic theology, he would be tempted to
exclaim, in the words of a familiar epitaph, ‘Si monumentum quaeris,
circumspice.’ Abélard’s most characteristic principles are now
amongst the accepted foundations of dogmatic theology; most, or, at
all events, a large number, of the conclusions that brought such
wrath about him in the twelfth century are now calmly taught in the
schools of Rome and Louvain and Freiburg. Bernardism has been almost
banished from the courts of the temple. The modern theologian could
not face the modern world with the thoughts of the saint whose bones
are treasured in a thousand jewelled reliquaries; he must speak the
thoughts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span>
heretic, who lies by the side of his beloved, amidst the soldiers
and statesmen, the actresses and courtesans, of Paris. The great
political organisation that once found it expedient to patronise
Bernardism has now taken the spirit of Abélard into the very heart of
its official teaching.</p>

<p>There are few in England who will read such an assertion without
a feeling of perplexity, if not incredulity. Far and wide over
the realm of theology has the spirit of Abélard breathed; and
ever-widening spheres of Evangelicalism, Deism, Pantheism, and
Agnosticism mark its growth. But it is understood that Rome has
resisted the spirit of rationalism, and to-day, as ever, bids human
reason bow in submission before the veiled mysteries of ‘the deposit
of revelation.’</p>

<p>Yet the assertion involves no strain or ingenuity of
interpretation of Catholic theology. The notion that Rome rebukes the
imperious claims of reason is one of a number of strangely-enduring
fallacies concerning that Church. The truth of our thesis can be
swiftly and clearly established. The one essential source of the
antagonism of St. Bernard and Abélard was the question of the
relations of faith and reason. ‘Faith precedes intellect,’ said the
Cistercian; ‘Reason precedes faith,’ said the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span> Benedictine. All other quarrels were
secondary and were cognate to their profound and irreconcilable
opposition on this point. M. Guizot adds a second fundamental
opposition on the ethical side. This, however, was certainly of a
secondary importance. Few historians hesitate to regard the famous
struggle as being in the main a dispute over the rights and duties of
reason.</p>

<p>Turn then from the pontificate of Innocent <small>II.</small>
to that of Pius <small>IX.</small> and of Leo <small>XIII.</small>
Towards the close of the last century, Huet, Bishop of Avranches,
began to meet rationalistic attacks with a belittlement of human
reason. The idea found favour with a class of apologists. De Bonald,
Bonetty, Bautain, and others in France, and the Louvain theologians
in Belgium, came entirely to repudiate the interference of reason
with regard to higher truths, saying that their acceptance was solely
a matter of faith and tradition. Well, the Church of Rome (to which
all belonged) descended upon the new sect with a remarkable severity.
Phrases that were purely Bernardist in form and substance were
rigorously condemned. The French ‘Traditionalists’ were forced to
subscribe to (amongst others) the following significant proposition:
‘The use of reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p.
332]</span> precedes faith, and leads up to it, with the aid of
revelation and grace.’ It was the principle which Abélard’s whole
life was spent in vindicating. The Louvain men wriggled for many
months under the heel of Rome. They were not suffered to rest until
they had cast away the last diluted element of their theory.</p>

<p>The episode offers a very striking exhibition of the entire
change of front of Rome with regard to ‘the rights of reason.’ There
are many other official utterances in the same sense. An important
provincial council, held at Cologne in 1860, and fully authorised,
discussed the question at length. ‘We have no faith,’ it enacted,
‘until we have seen with our reason that God is worthy of credence
and that He has spoken to us’; and again, ‘The firmness of faith
... requires that he who believes must have a preliminary <i>rational
certitude</i> of the existence of God and the fact of a revelation
having come from Him, and he must have no prudent doubt on the
matter.’ In the Encyclical of 1846 even Pius <small>IX.</small>
insisted on the same principle: ‘Human reason, to avoid the danger
of deception and error, must diligently search out the fact of a
divine revelation, and must attain a <i>certainty</i> that the message
comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span> from
God, so that, as the Apostle most wisely ordains, it may offer Him
a “reasonable service.”’ The Vatican Council of 1870 was equally
explicit. The modern Catholic theologian, in his treatise on faith,
invariably defines it as an intellectual act, an acceptance of truths
after a satisfactory rational inquiry into the authority that urges
them. It is official Catholic teaching that faith is impossible
without a previous rational certitude. Moreover, the theologian
admits that every part and particle of the dogmatic system must meet
the criticism of reason. In the positive sense it is indispensable
that reason prove the existence of God, the authority of God, and the
divinity of the Scriptures. In the negative sense, no single dogma
must contain an assertion which is clearly opposed to a proved fact
or to a clear pronouncement of human reason or the human conscience.
These are not the speculations of advanced theologians, but the
current teaching in the Roman schools and manuals<a id="FNanchor_38"
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of dogmatic
theology.</p>

<p>Thus has history vindicated the heretic. The multiplication
of churches has made the Bernardist<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span> notion of faith wholly untenable and
unserviceable to Rome. Reason precedes faith; reason must lead men to
faith, and make faith acceptable to men. That is the gospel that now
falls on the dead ear of the great master.</p>

<p>And when we pass from this fundamental principle or attitude to
a consideration of special points of dogma we again meet with many
a triumph. We have already seen how Abélard’s ‘novelties’ may be
traced to a twofold criticism—ethical and intellectual—of the form in
which Christian dogmas were accepted in his day. Without explicitly
formulating it, Abélard proceeded on the principle which is now
complacently laid down by the Catholic theologian, and was accepted
by the Christian world at large a century or half a century ago:
the principle that what is offered to us as revealed truth must be
tested by the declarations of the mind and of the conscience. The
intellectual criticism led him to alter the terms of the dogmas of
the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Eucharist, and others; the ethical
criticism led him to modify the current theories of original sin, the
atonement, penance, and so forth.</p>

<p>Now, even if we confine our attention to Roman theology, we find a
large adoption of Abélard’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p.
335]</span> singularly prophetic conclusions. As to the Trinity,
it is now a universal and accepted practice to illustrate it by
analogies derived from purely natural phenomena, which are always
heretical if taken literally. One of the proudest achievements of
St. Thomas and the schoolmen was the construction of an elaborate
analogical conception of the Trinity. On the equally important
question of Scripture Abélard’s innovation proved prophetic. In
that age of the doctrine of verbal inspiration he drew attention
to the human element in the Bible. Even the Catholic Bible is no
longer a monochrome. Abélard’s speculation about the ‘accidents’ in
the Eucharist—that they are based on the substance of the air—is
now widely and freely accepted by theologians. His moral principles
relating to sins done in ignorance and to ‘suggestion, delectation,
and consent’—both of which were condemned, at Bernard’s demand—are
recognised to be absolutely sound by the modern casuist. His notion
of heaven is the current esoteric doctrine in Rome to-day; his theory
of hell is widely held, in spite of a recent official censure; his
pleading for Plato and his fellow-heathens would be seconded by the
average Catholic theologian of to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out how entirely the non-Roman
theology of the nineteenth century has accepted Abélard’s spirit
and conclusions. The broadest feature of the history of theology
during the century has been the resumption and the development
of the modifying process which was started by Abélard eight
centuries ago. The world at large has taken up his speculations
on the Incarnation, the atonement, original sin, responsibility,
inspiration, confession, hell and heaven, and so many other points,
and given them that development from which the dutiful son of the
Church inconsistently shrank.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> A curious and striking proof of this
may be taken from Tholuck’s dissertation on ‘Abélard and Aquinas
as interpreters of Scripture.’ The dis<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span>tinguished German theologian, who is the
author of a well-known commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, says
that when he read Abélard’s commentary on that Epistle, in preparing
his own work, he seriously hesitated whether it would not suffice to
republish the forgotten work of Abélard instead of writing a new one.
When one recollects what an epitome of theology such a commentary
must be, one can appreciate not only the great homage it involves to
the genius of the man whom Bernard scornfully calls a ‘dabbler in
theology,’ but the extent to which Abélard anticipated the mature
judgment of theological science.</p>

<p>It seems, however, a superfluous task to point out the acceptance
of Abélard’s spirit, method, and results by theology in general. The
more interesting and important question is the acceptance of his
ideas by the Church of Rome. That we have abundantly established, and
we may now proceed to inquire whether, and to what extent, Abélard
had a direct influence in the abandonment of the mystic attitude and
the adoption of one which may be fairly entitled ‘rationalistic.’</p>

<p>Here we have a much more difficult problem to deal with. It may
at once be frankly avowed that there is little evidence of a direct
transition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>
Abélard’s ideas into the accepted scheme of theology. Some of the
most careful and patient biographers of Abélard, as a theologian,
say that we cannot claim for him any direct influence on the course
of theological development. Deutsch points out that his works must
have become rare, and the few copies secretly preserved, after their
condemnation by the pope; certainly few manuscripts of them have
survived. He had formed no theological school (as distinct from
philosophical), or the beginning of one must have been crushed at
Sens. His Roman pupils and admirers were probably not men who would
cultivate loyalty under unfavourable circumstances. The schoolmen
of the following century only know Abélard from passages in Hugh of
St. Victor and others of his enemies. The first to reproduce what
Deutsch takes to be the characteristic spirit or method of Abélard
is Roger Bacon; it is extremely doubtful if he had any acquaintance
whatever with Abélard. The world was prepared to receive the ideas of
Abélard with some respect in the thirteenth century, but it had then
a task which was too absorbing to allow a search for the manuscripts
of ‘a certain Abélard,’ as one later theologian put it. The Arabians
and Jews had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span>
reintroduced Aristotle into Europe. He had come to stay; and the
schoolmen were engrossed in the work of fitting him with garments of
Christian theology.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are historians, such as Reuter, who grant
Abélard a large measure of direct influence on the development
of theology. It is pointed out that a very large proportion of
the masters of the next generation had studied under Abélard.
Reuter instances Bernard Sylvester of Chartres and William of
Conches, as well as Gilbert de la Porée. Clearer instances of
direct influence are found in the case of Master Roland of Bologna
(afterwards to ascend the papal throne under the name of Alexander
<small>III.</small>) and Master Omnebene of the same city. It is, in
any case, quite clear that Abélard was pre-eminently a teacher of
teachers. On the other hand it would be incorrect to lay too much
stress on the condemnation by Pope Innocent. All the world knew
that Bernard had prudently kept the unexecuted Bull in his pocket,
and that Abélard was teaching theology at Cluny, with the pope’s
approval, a few months after the condemnation.</p>

<p>It is best to distinguish once more between the spirit or method
of Abélard and his particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p.
340]</span> critical conclusions. His conclusions, his suggestions
for the reconstruction of certain dogmas, were lost to theological
science. The cruder notions of the earlier age and of Bernard
continued to be regarded as <i>the</i> truth for many centuries. Even the
masters, such as Roland of Bologna, who did found their theology
more conspicuously on that of Abélard, prudently deviated from his
opinions where they were ‘offensive to pious ears.’ His treatment
of the Trinity is, perhaps, an exception. Not that Abélard’s
favourite analogies—that of the seal and its impression, and so
forth—were retained, but he had set an example in the rationalistic
or naturalistic illustration of the mystery which persisted in the
schools. All the great schoolmen of the following century accepted
the Abélardist notion of a rationalistic illustration and defence
of the Trinity. They constructed an elaborately meaningless analogy
of it, and invented a ‘virtual’ distinction—a mental distinction
which might be taken to be objective for apologetic purposes—between
the essence and the personalities. But Abélard’s penetrating and
reconstructive criticisms of the current dogmas of original sin, the
Incarnation, responsibility, reward and punishment, inspiration,
omnipotence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span>
etc., degenerated into, at the most, obscure heresies—sank back into
the well of truth until long after a rebellious monk had broken the
bonds which held the intellect of Europe.</p>

<p>It was far otherwise with the spirit of Abélard, the fundamental
principle or maxim on which all else depended. The thirteenth
century cordially accepted that principle, and applied itself to the
rationalisation of theology. It wholly abandoned the mysticism of
Bernard and the school of St. Victor. The Cistercian had summed up
Abélard’s misdeeds thus in his letter to the pope: ‘He peers into
the heavens and searches the hidden things of God, then, returning
to us, he holds discourse on ineffable things of which a man may
not speak.’ In the very sense in which this was said of Abélard,
it may be urged as a chief characteristic of the saintly schoolmen
of the thirteenth century. Even St. Bonaventure was no mystic in
the anti-rational sense of Bernard; simply, he applied to theology
the reason of Plato instead of the reason of Aristotle. Archbishop
Roger Vaughan, in his <i>Life of St. Thomas</i>, says that the schoolmen
owed the ‘<i>probatur ratione</i>’ in their <i>loci theologici</i> to Abélard.
That is already a most striking vindication of Abélard’s<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p. 342]</span> characteristic teaching
as to the function of reason, for we know how important the ‘proofs
from reason’ were in the scheme of Aquinas and Scotus. But they
really owe far more than this to Abélard. If they have deserted the
dreamy, rambling, fruitless, and fantastic speculation of the mystic
school for a methodical and syllogistic inquiry concerning each point
of faith, it is largely due to the example of Abélard. The schoolmen
notoriously followed Peter the Lombard. From the <i>Sentences</i> of
Peter the Lombard to the <i>Sic et Non</i> of Peter Abélard—through
such works as the <i>Sentences</i> of Roland and Omnebene of Bologna
and the so-called <i>Sentences of Peter Abélard</i>—is a short and easy
journey. No doubt we must not lose sight of that other event which
so powerfully influenced the theology of the thirteenth century:
the invasion of the Arab and Jew philosophers. Theirs is the only
influence of which the schoolmen show any consciousness in their
elaborate fortification of dogma to meet the criticism of reason and
conscience—except for the avowed influence of the Lombard; and along
that line we may trace the direct influence of Abélard.</p>

<p>In the circumstances it makes little difference<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span> to the prestige of
Abélard whether we succeed in proving a direct influence or no.
There are few who will think less of him because he was beaten by
St. Bernard in diplomatic manipulation of the political force of the
Church. The times were not ripe for the acceptance of his particular
criticisms, and the mystic school was the natural expression of this
conservatism. We may even doubt if Deutsch is correct in saying that
the thirteenth century was prepared to receive them, but that its
attention was diverted to Spain. Renan has said that they who study
the thirteenth century closely are astonished that Protestantism did
not arise three hundred years earlier. That is the point of view of
a logician. The Reformation was not in reality, though it seems such
in theory to the student of the history of ideas, an intellectual
development. No doubt it could not have succeeded without this
development to appeal to, but it was a moral and political revolt.
How little the world was prepared for such a revolt at the end of the
thirteenth century may be gathered from a study of the life of that
other rebellious monk, William Occam. This success the Anselms and
Bernards achieved: they spread, with a moral renovation, a spirit
of docility and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span>
loyalty to the Church. The subtlety and intellectual activity they
could not arrest came to be used up in an effort to restate the older
dogmas in terms which should be at once conservative and acceptable
to the new rational demand.</p>

<p>It is equally difficult and more interesting to determine how far
Abélard himself was created by predecessors. Nowadays no thought is
revolutionary; but some notions are more rapid in their evolution
than others. To what extent Abélard’s ideas were thus borrowed
from previous thinkers it is not easy to determine with precision.
He was far from being the first rationalist of the Middle Ages.
Scotus Erigena and Bérenger (of anti-sacramental fame) were well
remembered in his day. He himself studied under a rationalistic
master—Jean Roscelin, canon of Compiègne,—in his early years. We
do not know with certainty at what age he studied under Roscelin,
and cannot, therefore, determine how great an influence the older
master exercised over him. But there can be little doubt that Abélard
must be credited with a very large force of original genius. At
the most, the attitude of his mind towards dogma was determined
by outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span>
influences, concurring with his own temperament and character
of mind. It is more than probable that this attitude would have
been adopted by him even had there been no predisposing influence
whatever. His rationalism flows spontaneously and irresistibly from
his type of mind and character. In the development of the rationalist
principle we see the exclusive action of his own intelligence.
To most of us in this generation such dogmatic reconstruction as
Abélard urged seems obvious enough; yet one needs little imagination
to appreciate the mental power or, rather, penetration, which was
necessary to realise its necessity in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>One is tempted at times to speculate on the probable development
of Abélard’s thoughts if that great shadow had not fallen on his life
at so early a period. There are two Abélards. The older theologian,
who is ever watchful to arrest his thoughts when they approach
clear, fundamental dogmas, is not the natural development of the
freethinking author of the <i>Sic et Non</i>. With the conversion to the
ascetic ideal had come a greater awe in approaching truths which
were implicitly accepted as divine. Yet we may well doubt if Abélard
would ever have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span>
advanced much beyond his actual limits. Starting from the world of
ideas in which he lived, he would have needed an exceptional strength
to proceed to any very defiant and revolutionary conclusions. He was
not of the stuff of martyrs, of Scotus Erigena, or Arnold of Brescia.
He had no particle of the political ability of Luther. But such as
he is, gifted with a penetrating mind, and led by a humanist ideal
that touched few of his contemporaries, pathetically irresolute and
failing because the fates had made him the hero of a great drama and
ironically denied him the hero’s strength, he deserves at least to
be drawn forth from the too deep shadow of a crude and unsympathetic
tradition.</p>

<p id="Footnote_1"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_1">[1]</a></span> I am thinking, of course, of
the thousands of simple folk who rushed blindfold into the fatal
procession towards Jerusalem, setting their children on their rude
carts, and asking naïvely, at each tower that came in sight in their
own France, if that was the Holy City: those whose bones marked
the path to Palestine for later Crusaders. As to the professional
warriors, there is surely more humour than aught else in the picture
of the King of France and his like setting forth to ‘do penance’ for
their vice and violence by a few months of adventure, carnage, and
pillage.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_2"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_2">[2]</a></span> Locmenach = <i>locus monachorum</i>,
‘the place of the monks.’ The older name was Moriacum. It is now
called Locminé, and lies a few miles to the east of Vannes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_3"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_3">[3]</a></span> The name occurs in a dozen
different forms in the ancient records. I adopt the form which
is generally used by modern French writers. D’Argentré and other
historians of Brittany say that it was not unknown about Nantes in
those days. We must remember that it was the period when nicknames,
trade-names, etc., were passing into surnames. Another pun on the
name, which greatly tickled the mediæval imagination, was ‘Aboilar,’
supposed to convey the idea that he was a dog who barks at heaven
(<i>aboie le ciel</i>). It was perpetrated by Hugo Metellus, a rival
master.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_4"><span class="label"><a

from fragments of the minor poets of the time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_5"><span class="label"><a

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_6"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_6">[6]</a></span> Lest there be a suspicion of
caricature, or of ignorance (though I too have sat in the chair of
scholastic philosophy, and held grave discourse on <i>genera</i> and
<i>species</i>), let me remind the reader of the theological import which
was read into the problem.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_7"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_7">[7]</a></span> The reader would probably not be
grateful for a long explanation of the meaning of the change. It
amounted to a considerable approach of William’s position towards
that of Abélard.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_8"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_8">[8]</a></span> To transfer a chair was frequently
a physical operation in those days. There is, in one of the old
records, a story of a dissatisfied master and his pupils removing
their chair to another town, higher up the river. They were not
welcome, it seems, and their chair was pitched into the river to find
its way home.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_9"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_9">[9]</a></span> Until a comparatively recent date
‘aller sur le Pré’ meant, in the language of the Latin Quarter, to
settle an affair of honour.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_10"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_10">[10]</a></span> As a mere illustration of
the times—no one would think of taking it seriously—we may quote
the passage referring to him in Dubois’s <i>Historia Ecclesiæ
Parisiensis</i> (also found in Lobineau). A monk and bishop, Gaufridus
Vindoniencensis, writes to remonstrate with Robert for ‘inventing
a new kind of martyrdom’ ... ‘inter feminas et cum ipsis noctu
frequenter cubare. Hinc tibi videris, ut asseris, Domini Salvatoris
digne bajulare crucem, cum extinguere conaris male accensum carnis
ardorem.’ Later he complains of Robert’s partiality, treating some
nuns with unusual sweetness and others with excessive acrimony; and
amongst the punishments inflicted on the latter he mentions the
penance of ‘stripping.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_11"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_11">[11]</a></span> It will interest many, however,
to learn (from the pages of Du Boulai’s <i>Historia Universitatis
Parisiensis</i>) that he is charged by the querulous Gaufridus
Vindoniencensis with teaching that only the gravest sins were matter
for obligatory confession. These particularly grave transgressions
are heresy, schism, paganism, and Judaism—all non-ethical matters!</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_12"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_12">[12]</a></span> When Anselm’s guilt was
ultimately proved, people were somewhat troubled as to the
ill-success of their Providential detective service, until they heard
that the goldsmith, in accusing the canon, had broken faith with
him.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_13"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_13">[13]</a></span> Luckily the citizen-parents were
wiser than their Solomon for once. They proposed that the process
should commence with the seven treasurers. In spite of preliminary
experiments in private the canon was convicted. But the reader must
go to the pious Geoffroy’s narrative (<i>Migne</i>, vol. 156, col. 1011)
to read how the burglar was tortured, how he obtained release for
a time by trickery, and how, being unable to sleep at night for a
miraculous dove, he finally confessed and restored.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_14"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_14">[14]</a></span> The Count of Anjou had just
invented them to hide the enormity of his bunions. Flattering
courtiers found them excellent. The English king’s jester had
exaggerated the turned-up points, and the nobles were driving the
practice to death, as is the aristocratic wont.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_16"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_16">[16]</a></span> Not a single one of Abélard’s
songs has come down to us. A few songs are to be found which bear his
name, but they are not genuine. It is an unfortunate loss, since the
religious hymns of his later years convey no better impression of his
true and unspoiled poetic faculty than the moonlight does of the rays
of the sun.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_17"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_17">[17]</a></span> This detail is found in Abélard’s
second letter to Heloise. It is characteristic of Mr. Cotter
Morison’s ‘sketch’ of Abélard that he should have missed it, and
thought fit to deny it. Deutsch reads him a severe lesson on the duty
of accuracy in his <i>Peter Abälard</i>.</p>

<p id="Footnote_21"><span class="label"><a

drawn my attention to Elwin’s theory (Pope’s Works) that he
followed the translation of J. Hughes, author of the <i>Siege of
Damascus</i>. Hughes’s ‘translation’ was little more faithful than
the current French versions; it is largely a work of imagination.
Careful comparison does seem to show that Pope used this version,
but he seems also to have used some of the very misleading French
paraphrases. Elwin himself thinks Pope did not look at the original

feeble creation of Robert Buchanan in such a company, but his ‘New
Abélard’ is a further illustration. His pitiful Mr. Bradley has no
earthly resemblance to Abélard, except in a most superficial sense.
It is grotesque to compare him to Abélard for his ‘heresy’; and
to say that he recalls Abélard in his weakness (to the extent of
bigamously marrying and blasting the life of a noble woman) is deeply
unjust. Abélard was not a cad.</p>

purpose, and probably the reader’s pleasure, to give an analysis of
these works. I shall presently treat the specific points that have
relation to his condemnation, and I add a supplementary chapter on
his teaching in general. Deutsch may be read by the curious, and Herr
Hausrath gives a useful shorter analysis.</p>

<p id="Footnote_26"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_26">[26]</a></span> A good idea of the man, and of
the rapidly growing school he belonged to, will be formed from the
opening sentence of one of his treatises: ‘Rotting in the lake of
misery and in the mire of filth, and stuck in the mud of the abyss
that has no substance, and from the depths of my grief, I cry out
to Thee, O Lord.’ He was in the midst of a similar Bernardesque
composition when he received Abélard’s works.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_31"><span class="label"><a

who credits Bernard with writing the report, should speak of the
words as a deliberate ‘lie of excuse,’ especially as he adopts the
witness of Bérenger to a previous condemnation. We are not only
compelled by independent evidence to take them as correct, but one
imputes a lesser sin to Bernard (from the Catholic point of view) in
doing so.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_32"><span class="label"><a

<p id="Footnote_33"><span class="label"><a

<p id="Footnote_35"><span class="label"><a

Bernard’s conduct, or making the ethical and psychological analysis
of it, which is so imperfectly done by his biographers at this
period, because they do not fully state the facts, or not in their
natural order. It would be a fascinating task, but one beside the
purpose of the present work and not discreet for the present writer.
I have let Bernard speak for himself.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_36"><span class="label"><a

of these manuals at present is that of the learned Jesuit, Father
Hurter. On p. 472 of the first volume one finds the Bernardist
notions of faith sternly rejected, and variously attributed to
‘Protestants,’ ‘Pietists,’ and ‘Kantists.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_39"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_39">[39]</a></span> A typical illustration of the
perplexity and inconsistency which resulted from the conflict of
Abélard’s critical moral sense with apparently fixed dogmas is seen
in his treatment of original sin in the <i>Commentary on the Epistle
to the Romans</i>. He finds two meanings for the word sin—guilt and
punishment; and he strains his conscience to the point of admitting
that we may inherit Adam’s sin in the latter sense. Then comes the
question of unbaptized children—whom Bernard calmly consigned to
Hades—and he has to produce the extraordinary theory that the Divine
Will is the standard of morality, and so cannot act unjustly. But
his conscience asserts itself, and he goes on to say that their
punishment will only be a negative one—the denial of the sight of
God—and will only be inflicted on those children who, in the divine
prescience, would have been wicked had they lived!</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
